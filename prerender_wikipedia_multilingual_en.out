02/16/2024 01:02:56 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 4 unknown glyphs in sentence: The word alchemy comes from old French alquemie, alkimie, used in Medieval Latin as . This name was itself adopted from the Arabic word  (). The Arabic  in turn was a borrowing of the Late Greek term khēmeía (), also spelled khumeia () and khēmía (), with al- being the Arabic definite article 'the'. Together this association can be interpreted as 'the process of transmutation by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form'. Several etymologies have been proposed for the Greek term. The first was proposed by Zosimos of Panopolis (3rd–4th centuries), who derived it from the name of a book, the Khemeu. Hermann Diels argued in 1914 that it rather derived from χύμα, used to describe metallic objects formed by casting.  Others trace its roots to the Egyptian name  (hieroglyphic 𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖  ), meaning 'black earth', which refers to the fertile and auriferous soil of the Nile valley, as opposed to red desert sand. According to the Egyptologist Wallis Budge, the Arabic word ʾ actually means "the Egyptian [science]", borrowing from the Coptic word for "Egypt",  (or its equivalent in the Mediaeval Bohairic dialect of Coptic, ). This Coptic word derives from Demotic , itself from ancient Egyptian . The ancient Egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour "black" (Egypt was the "black Land", by contrast with the "red Land", the surrounding desert).  History .

02/16/2024 01:03:03 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 10 unknown glyphs in sentence: Typography  The word  is always written without an  to spell the  vowel. This is because the spelling was settled before Arabic spelling started habitually using  to spell . However, in vocalized spelling, a small diacritic  is added on top of the  to indicate the pronunciation.  In the pre-Islamic Zabad inscription, God is referred to by the term , that is, alif-lam-alif-lam-ha. This presumably indicates Al-'ilāh = "the god", without alif for ā.  Many Arabic type fonts feature special ligatures for Allah.  Since Arabic script is used to write other texts rather than Koran only, rendering  +  +  as the previous ligature is considered faulty which is the case with most common Arabic typefaces.  Unicode Unicode has a code point reserved for ,  = U+FDF2, in the Arabic Presentation Forms-A block, which exists solely for "compatibility with some older, legacy character sets that encoded presentation forms directly"; this is discouraged for new text. Instead, the word  should be represented by its individual Arabic letters, while modern font technologies will render the desired ligature.  The calligraphic variant of the word used as the emblem of Iran is encoded in Unicode, in the Miscellaneous Symbols range, at code point U+262B (☫).

02/16/2024 01:03:35 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 3 unknown glyphs in sentence: Ammon (Ammonite: 𐤏𐤌𐤍 ʻAmān;  ; ) was an ancient Semitic-speaking kingdom occupying the east of the Jordan River, between the torrent valleys of Arnon and Jabbok, in present-day Jordan. The chief city of the country was Rabbah or Rabbat Ammon, site of the modern city of Amman, Jordan's capital. Milcom and Molech are named in the Hebrew Bible as the gods of Ammon. The people of this kingdom are called Children of Ammon or Ammonites.  History  The Ammonites occupied the northern Central Trans-Jordanian Plateau from the latter part of the second millennium BC to at least the second century AD.  Ammon maintained its independence from the Neo-Assyrian Empire (10th to 7th centuries BC) by paying tribute to the Assyrian kings at a time when that Empire raided or conquered nearby kingdoms. The Kurkh Monolith lists the Ammonite king Baasha ben Ruhubi's army as fighting alongside Ahab of Israel and Syrian allies against Shalmaneser III at the Battle of Qarqar in 853 BC, possibly as vassals of Hadadezer, the Aramaean king of Damascus. In 734 BC the Ammonite king Sanipu was a vassal of Tiglath-Pileser III of Assyria, and Sanipu's successor Pudu-ilu held the same position under Sennacherib () and Esarhaddon (). An Assyrian tribute-list exists from this period, showing that Ammon paid one-fifth as much tribute as Judah did. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

Ashoka's Lumbini pillar inscription commemorates the Emperor's pilgrimage to Lumbini as the Buddha's birthplace, calling him the Buddha Shakyamuni (Brahmi script: 𑀩𑀼𑀥 𑀲𑀓𑁆𑀬𑀫𑀼𑀦𑀻 Bu-dha Sa-kya-mu-nī, "Buddha, Sage of the Shakyas").  Shakyamuni () means "Sage of the Shakyas".  Tathāgata Tathāgata (Pali; ) is a term the Buddha commonly used when referring to himself or other Buddhas in the Pāli Canon. The exact meaning of the term is unknown, but it is often thought to mean either "one who has thus gone" (tathā-gata), "one who has thus come" (tathā-āgata), or sometimes "one who has thus not gone" (tathā-agata). This is interpreted as signifying that the Tathāgata is beyond all coming and going – beyond all transitory phenomena. A tathāgata is "immeasurable", "inscrutable", "hard to fathom", and "not apprehended".

These include texts such as the "Discourse on the Noble Quest" (Ariyapariyesanā-sutta) and its parallels in other languages.  Pillar and rock inscriptions  No written records about Gautama were found from his lifetime or from the one or two centuries thereafter. But from the middle of the 3rd century BCE, several Edicts of Ashoka (reigned c. 268 to 232 BCE) mention the Buddha and Buddhism. Particularly, Ashoka's Lumbini pillar inscription commemorates the Emperor's pilgrimage to Lumbini as the Buddha's birthplace, calling him the Buddha Shakyamuni (Brahmi script: 𑀩𑀼𑀥 𑀲𑀓𑁆𑀬𑀫𑀼𑀦𑀻 Bu-dha Sa-kya-mu-nī, "Buddha, Sage of the Shakyas"). Another one of his edicts (Minor Rock Edict No. 3) mentions the titles of several Dhamma texts (in Buddhism, "dhamma" is another word for "dharma"), establishing the existence of a written Buddhist tradition at least by the time of the Maurya era. These texts may be the precursor of the Pāli Canon.  "Sakamuni" is also mentioned in a relief of Bharhut, dated to c. 100 BCE, in relation with his illumination and the Bodhi tree, with the inscription Bhagavato Sakamunino Bodho ("The illumination of the Blessed Sakamuni").

02/16/2024 01:04:31 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 2 unknown glyphs in sentence: The name "Bluetooth" was proposed in 1997 by Jim Kardach of Intel, one of the founders of the Bluetooth SIG. The name was inspired by a conversation with Sven Mattisson who related Scandinavian history through tales from Frans G. Bengtsson's The Long Ships, a historical novel about Vikings and the 10th-century Danish king Harald Bluetooth. Upon discovering a picture of the runestone of Harald Bluetooth in the book A History of the Vikings by Gwyn Jones, Kardach proposed Bluetooth as the codename for the short-range wireless program which is now called Bluetooth.  According to Bluetooth's official website,  Bluetooth is the Anglicised version of the Scandinavian Blåtand/Blåtann (or in Old Norse blátǫnn). It was the epithet of King Harald Bluetooth, who united the disparate  Danish tribes into a single kingdom; Kardach chose the name to imply that Bluetooth similarly unites communication protocols.  The Bluetooth logo  is a bind rune merging the Younger Futhark runes  (ᚼ, Hagall) and  (ᛒ, Bjarkan), Harald's initials.  History  . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

Although his son Inel Khagan succeeded him, Bilgä's brother Kul Tigin and Tonyukuk carried out a coup d'état against Inel Qaghan. They killed him and made him Bilgä Qaghan. His name literally means "wise king".  He appointed his brother Kul Tigin to be Left Wise Prince, which made second most powerful person in realm. He re-subdued Huige in 716. He also appointed his father-in-law Tonyukuk to be Master Strategist.  New reforms and stabilization of the regime, caused tribes that fled Tujue to come back. Tang chancellor Wang Jun, believing that the Göktürks who surrendered would try to flee back to the Göktürk state, suggested that they be forcibly moved into the heart of the empire to prevent them from doing so. Before Wang's suggestion could be acted upon, however, there was an uprising by the Göktürks who surrendered, under the leadership of Xiedie Sitai (𨁂跌思泰) and Axilan (阿悉爛). Xue and Wang tried to intercept them and dealt them defeats, but they were able to flee back to the Göktürk state anyway. This defeat led to Xue Ne's retirement.  Religious policy .

02/16/2024 01:04:38 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: The bicycle's invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing modern industrial methods. Several components that played a key role in the development of the automobile were initially invented for use in the bicycle, including ball bearings, pneumatic tires, chain-driven sprockets and tension-spoked wheels.  Etymology The word bicycle first appeared in English print in The Daily News in 1868, to describe "Bysicles and trysicles" on the "Champs Elysées and Bois de Boulogne". The word was first used in 1847 in a French publication to describe an unidentified two-wheeled vehicle, possibly a carriage. The design of the bicycle was an advance on the velocipede, although the words were used with some degree of overlap for a time.  Other words for bicycle include "bike", "pushbike", "pedal cycle", or "cycle". In Unicode, the code point for "bicycle" is 0x1F6B2. The entity &#x1F6B2; in HTML produces 🚲.  Although bike and cycle are used interchangeably to refer mostly to two types of two-wheelers, the terms still vary across the world. In India, for example, a cycle refers only to a two-wheeler using pedal power whereas the term bike is used to describe a two-wheeler using internal combustion engine or electric motors as a source of motive power instead of motorcycle/motorbike.

02/16/2024 01:04:45 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: In 1998, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group published a phylogeny for flowering plants based on an analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants. As a result of this work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of angiosperms, have now been answered. Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants. Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa. Technological developments such as computers and electron microscopes have greatly increased the level of detail studied and speed at which data can be analysed.  Symbols  A few symbols are in current use in botany. A number of others are obsolete; for example, Linnaeus used planetary symbols  (Mars) for biennial plants,  (Jupiter) for herbaceous perennials and  (Saturn) for woody perennials, based on the planets' orbital periods of 2, 12 and 30 years; and Willd used  (Saturn) for neuter in addition to  (Mercury) for hermaphroditic.

02/16/2024 01:04:58 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 4 unknown glyphs in sentence: Other authors have suggested older origins for the name, in particular the name Bagdadu or Hudadu that existed in Old Babylonian (spelled with a sign that can represent both bag and hu), and the Jewish Babylonian Aramaic name of a place called "Baghdatha" (. Some scholars suggested Aramaic derivations. In Hindu Puranas, It is mentioned that the city was named after King Bhagadatta.  Another view, suggested by Christophe Wall-Romana, is that name of "Baghdad" is derived from "Akkad", as the cuneiform logogram for Akkad (𒀀𒂵𒉈𒆠) is pronounced "a-ga-dèKI" ("Agade") and its resemblance to "Baghdad" is compelling.  When the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur founded a completely new city for his capital, he chose the name City of Peace (Arabic: مدینه السلام), which now refers to the Round city of Baghdad proper. This was the official name on coins, weights, and other official usage, although the common people continued to use the old name. By the 11th century, "Baghdad" became almost the exclusive name for the world-renowned metropolis.  Christophe Wall-Romana has suggested that al-Mansur's choice to found his 'new city' at Baghdad because of its strategic location was the same criteria which influenced Sargon's choice to found the original city of Akkad in the exact same location.

Late Medieval Cyrillic letters (categorized as vyaz' and still found on many icon inscriptions today) show a marked tendency to be very tall and narrow, with strokes often shared between adjacent letters.  Peter the Great, Tsar of Russia, mandated the use of westernized letter forms (ru) in the early 18th century. Over time, these were largely adopted in the other languages that use the script. Thus, unlike the majority of modern Greek fonts that retained their own set of design principles for lower-case letters (such as the placement of serifs, the shapes of stroke ends, and stroke-thickness rules, although Greek capital letters do use Latin design principles), modern Cyrillic fonts are much the same as modern Latin fonts of the same font family. The development of some Cyrillic computer typefaces from Latin ones has also contributed to the visual Latinization of Cyrillic type.  Lowercase forms  .

In the ninth year of Hoshea, "the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes", resettling large numbers of population. (2 Kings 17:6)     The "men" from each of these five cities ("national groups" - NIV) made its own gods and set them up in the shrines of the land, mixing it with the worship of Jehovah. "The men of Babylon made Succoth Benoth, the men of Cuthah made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites ... Adrammelech and Anamelech." (2 Kings 17:30-31) The Bible says that these deities were idols, although the Samaritans were not punished because they worshipped the God of the Israelites as well.

02/16/2024 01:06:48 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 4 unknown glyphs in sentence: The Cedar Forest (Sumerian:	𒄑𒂞𒄑𒌁giš eren giš tir) is the glorious realm of the gods of Mesopotamian mythology.  It is guarded by the demigod Humbaba and was once entered by the hero Gilgamesh who dared cut down trees from its virgin stands during his quest for fame.  The Cedar Forest is described in Tablets 46 of the Epic of Gilgamesh.  Earlier Sumerian versions of the Epic of Gilgamesh say that Gilgamesh traveled east, presumably, to the Zagros mountains of Iran (ancient Elam) to the cedar forest, yet the later more extensive Babylonian examples place the cedar forests west in Lebanon.  In the Epic of Gilgamesh  Tablet 4 Tablet four tells the story of the  journey to the Cedar Forest. On each day of the six-day journey, Gilgamesh prays to Shamash; in response to these prayers, Shamash sends Gilgamesh oracular dreams during the night. The first is not preserved. In the second, Gilgamesh dreams that he wrestles a great bull that splits the ground with his breath. Enkidu interprets the dream for Gilgamesh: the dream means that Shamash, the bull, will protect Gilgamesh. In the third, Gilgamesh dreams:  The skies roared with thunder and the earth heaved,  Then came darkness and a stillness like death.  Lightning smashed the ground and fires blazed out;  Death flooded from the skies.  When the heat died and the fires went out,  The plains had turned to ash. .

02/16/2024 01:06:56 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: The đàn gáo (chữ Nôm: 彈𣂋) ("coconut shell fiddle") is a bowed string instrument, a part of the traditional Vietnamese orchestra. It is similar to the đàn hồ.  The instrument originated from South Viet Nam, and is used in entertainment contexts.  It can be played alone, as part of an orchestra, or to accompany cải lương (Vietnamese folk opera).  The instrument’s name can be broken down as “đàn” meaning string instrument, and “gáo” literally translated as an aged coconut shell used as a scooper.  The đàn gáo is most closely related to the fiddle in Anglo-American culture, and the yehu and banhu in Chinese culture.  Construction and design  The resonator of the đàn gáo is the coconut shell covered by leather.  The neck extends from the coconut shell without frets.  The head of the neck bends back and offers string adjusters.  There are only two strings for this instrument, and the material is silk, which today can also be substituted with metal.  The bow can be made of wood or bamboo, and the strings are also made of silk.  By gliding the bow along the strings of the đàn gáo, high and full pitched sounds are produced.    The sounds can be played with varying ranges of loudness as well as pitch range as long as the interval between the strings is a perfect fifth. .

02/16/2024 01:07:14 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 41 unknown glyphs in sentence: Some scholars, however, believe that the images of the Ledberg stone depict the final story of either Þorgautr or Gunna, who are memorialized in the runic inscription. If the images are followed in the same order as the runes are written, they seem to create a chronological account. The first image is of a ship; this depicts a journey abroad. Next, there is a figure walking to the left, carrying what is most likely a shield, in preparation for departure. In the third image, the figure is carrying weapons and a shield to the right, probably marching to battle. At the top of the second side of the stone, the figure's foot is being bitten by a wolf and finally, we see the figure legless with arms sprawled, likely lying dead on the battlefield. Wolves were often used in Viking art and poetry to signify combat, so it is thought to be unlikely that the figure fell in battle due to wounds caused by a wolf.  The warrior figures have shields, one carries a spear, and all have moustaches and beards, except for the Odin figure. The helmets are conical and similar in shape to those shown on the Bayeux Tapestry.  Inscription  The runic inscription of the Ledberg stone is carved in the Younger futhark, and is dated to the 11th century. It reads: §A ᛒᛁᛋᛁ ᛬ ᛋᛅᛏᛁ ᛬ ᛋᛏᛁ ᛬ ᚦᛁᛋᛁ ᛬ ᛁᚠᛏᛁᛦ ᛬ ᚦᚢᚱᚴᚢᛏ ᛬ ᚢ----ᚦᛁ ᛬ ᚠᛅᚦᚢᚱ.

He lived sometime near the fall of the Arsacid (Parthian) Empire in the early 3rd century.  Identity of Sasan  Medieval sources There are many slightly different stories concerning Sasan and his relation to Ardashir I, the founder of the Sasanian Empire. The northern Iranian historian Tabari mentions that Sasan married Rambehesht, a princess of the Bāzarangid family, the vassal dynasty of Pārs, and that Sasan was a grandfather of Ardashir I, while Papak is named as Ardashir I's father.  According to the Pahlavi book of Karnamak-i Artaxshir-i Papakan, Sasan's wife was a daughter of a nobleman called Papak. The marriage was arranged by Papak after hearing that Sasan has "Achamenian (Achaemenid) blood in him". Their son was Ardashir I.

This is sometimes called "open drain, drives high".  Open source  Open source output exposes the MOSFET's source as the output.  For a nMOS open source output, the drain is internally connected to the positive voltage rail, so the source outputs a high voltage when the transistor is on and is hi-Z when off.  For a pMOS open source output, the drain is internally connected to the low voltage rail, so the output instead connects to the low voltage rail when the transistor is on, or is hi-Z when off.  Summary of configurations   Configurations that internally connect to a high voltage are source drivers. Configurations that internally connect to a low voltage are sink drivers.

Applications  Note: this section primarily deals with npn open collectors, however nMOS open drain generally applies as well.  Logic-level conversion  Because the pull-up resistor is external and does not need to be connected to the chip supply voltage, a lower or higher voltage than the chip supply voltage can be used instead (provided it does not exceed the absolute maximum rating of the chip's output). Open outputs are therefore sometimes used to interface different families of devices that have different operating voltage levels. The open collector transistor can be rated to withstand a higher voltage than the chip supply voltage. This technique is commonly used by logic circuits operating at 5 V or lower to drive higher voltage devices such as electric motors, LEDs in series, 12 V relays, 50 V vacuum fluorescent displays, or Nixie tubes requiring more than 100 V.

In classical sources, Aria has been several times confused with the greater region of ancient Ariana, of which Aria formed a part.  Geography Aria was an Old Persian satrapy, which enclosed chiefly the valley of the Hari River (Greek , this being eponymous to the whole land according to Arrian) and which in antiquity was considered as particularly fertile and, above all, rich in wine. The region of Aria was separated by mountain ranges from the Paropamisadae in the east, Parthia in the west and Margiana and Hyrcania in the north, while a desert separated it from Carmania and Drangiana in the south. It is described in a very detailed manner by Ptolemy and Strabo and corresponds, according to that, almost to the Herat Province of today's Afghanistan. In this sense the term is used correctly by some writers, e.g. Herodotus (3.93.3, where the Areioi are mentioned together with the Parthians, Chorasmians, and Sogdians); Diodorus (17.105.7; 18.39.6); Strabo (2.1.14; 11.10.1, cf. also 11.8.1 and 8; 15.2.8 and 9); Arrian (Anabasis 3.25.1); Pomponius Mela (1.12, where we read that “nearest to India is Ariane, then Aria”). .

02/16/2024 01:15:55 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: Pisidian is written left to right in a script that closely resembles the Greek alphabet. A few letters are missing (phi, chi, psi, and possibly theta), and two others were added (characters F and И, both denoting a /w/- or /v/-sound). In recently discovered inscriptions two new signs 𐋌 and ╪ have turned up; they are rare and it is not clear whether they are variants of other signs or entirely different characters (maybe rare sibilants). Texts are written without word dividers.  A typical example (the accompanying relief shows two men and a veiled woman):   ΔΩΤΑΡΙΜΟΣΗΤΩΣΕΙΗΔΩΤ / ΡΙΣΔΩΤΑΡΙΕΝΕΙΣ   Δωταρι Μοσητωσ Ειη Δωτ<α>ρισ Δωταρι Ενεισ   [Here lie] Dotari, [son] of Moseto; Eie [daughter] of Dotari; [and] Dotari [son] of Enei.  Alternatively, the end of the line may (with a different word division) be read as Δωταριε Νεισ, with dative Dotarie, meaning (...) to Dotari [the son] of Nei. In addition, Ειη may also be a dative (= Ειε-ε). The whole line would then mean:   Dotari, [son] of Moseto, [has made this tomb] for Eie [daughter] of Dotari [and] for Dotari [son] of Enei.  Grammar  Due to the one-sided character of the inscriptions, little is known about the grammar.

KMEL-FM, the Bay's top urban station, imposed an unofficial but crippling blacklist of F.A.B.'s songs and guest appearances, due to petty personal grievances as well as the perceived slight of his successful show on a rival station, thereby significantly undermining his hometown visibility. Later, his breakout single, "Ghost Ride It," was the subject of controversy on two fronts – a national clamor over the hyphy practice of "ghost riding" described in the song (throwing a car in neutral, then jumping out and walking alongside or riding on the roof as it continues to move) and Columbia Pictures' threatened legal action over the use of the Ghostbusters logo in the video (the track samples the movie's theme song).

02/16/2024 01:19:23 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: The zanzhi (拶指) finger crusher was a Chinese instrument of torture consisting of small sticks strung together with cords, which when placed around the fingers and gradually pulled, caused agonizing pain in order to force a confession. Under traditional Chinese law, a person could not be convicted of a crime unless they confessed. The zanzhi was a legal and non-lethal torture method for forcing women to confess, and for men there was the similar and more painful jiagun (夾棍) ankle crusher with three wooden planks that slowly compressed the feet.  Names and pronunciations The word zǎnzhǐ is written with two Chinese characters. The first (拶) has alternate readings of zā meaning "to force; to compel; to press" or zǎn "to squeeze the fingers (an ancient form of torture); the instrument used in the torture" (Wenlin 2016). The second character zhǐ (指) represents the common term for "finger".  In terms of Chinese character classification, both these logographs are phono-semantic characters; with the semantically-significant radical of "hand" (扌) the tortured body part and phonetic elements of yì (𡿩 "flow") and of zhǐ (旨 "intention"). Instead of the "hand" radical, zan (拶) had a variant form (桚) with the "wood" radical (木), signifying the material used to make a finger press. .

02/16/2024 01:21:40 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 5 unknown glyphs in sentence: Yaudheya (Brahmi script: 𑀬𑁅𑀥𑁂𑀬) or Yoddheya Gana (Yoddheya Republic) was an ancient militant confederation based in the Eastern region of the Sapta Sindhu. The word Yaudheya is a derivative of the word from yodha meaning warriors and according to Pāṇini, the suffix '-ya', was significant of warrior tribes, which is supported by their resistance to invading empires such as the Kushan Empire and the Indo-Scythians. Rudradaman I of the Western Satraps notes in his Junagadh rock inscription that the Yaudheyas were 'heroes among all Kshatriya' and 'were loath to surrender'. They were noted as having a republic form of government, unique from other Janapadas which instead maintained monarchies.  Geography  According to Anant Sadashiv Altekar, numismatic evidence indicates that the territorial dominion of the Yaudheyas extended from Bahawalpur in the South-West to Ludhiana in the North-West, encompassing Delhi in the South-East and Saharanpur in the East. However, his research suggests that the Yaudheyas comprised not just one unified entity, but rather three separate republics. In addition to the aforementioned region, another republic was situated in Northern Rajasthan while a further one existed in Northern Pañcāla. He describes the capital as being situated in modern-day Rohtak. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.
02/16/2024 01:21:55 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 3 unknown glyphs in sentence: Pim weights were polished stones about 15 mm (5/8 inch) diameter, equal to about two-thirds of a Hebrew shekel.  Many specimens have been found since their initial discovery early in the 20th century, and each one weighs about 7.6 grams, compared to 11.5 grams of a shekel. Its name comes from the inscription seen across the top of its dome shape: the Phoenician letters 𐤐𐤉‬‬𐤌‬ (Hebrew , transliterated pym).  Impact Prior to the discovery of the weights by archaeologists, scholars did not know how to translate the word  (pîm) in 1 Samuel 13:21. Robert Alexander Stewart Macalister's excavations at Gezer (1902-1905 and 1907-1909) were published in 1912 with an illustration showing one such weight, which Macalister compared to another published in 1907 by Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau.  Here is the 1611 translation of the King James Version of the Bible:  Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.  The 1982 New King James Version rendered it:  And the charge for a sharpening was a pim for the plowshares, the mattocks, the forks, and the axes, and to set the points of the goads.

02/16/2024 01:23:23 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 6 unknown glyphs in sentence: Satakarni (also called Sātakarnī I, Brahmi script: 𑀲𑀸𑀢𑀓𑀡𑀺, Sātakaṇi) was the third of the Satavahana kings, who ruled the Deccan region of India. His reign is generally dated to 70-60 BCE, although some authors have claimed 187-177 BCE, and most recently dated to 88-42 BCE. It was thought there were "two Satakarnis" (Satakarni I and Satakarni II), however, Andrew Ollett argues that there is only one Satakarni, as the alleged first Satakarni is assigned ten years, and the second, fifty years by other scholars, but the only dated inscription of this king is Candankheda seal from his reign's year 30, around 60 BCE, and he ruled ca. 88-42 BCE.  Biography According to the Puranas, the Satavahana king Simuka was succeeded by his brother Krishna (also known as Kanha). According to Matsya Purana, Krishna was succeeded by Mallakarni, but according to other Puranas, he was succeeded by Satakarni. The Nanaghat cave inscription of Satakarni lists his family members: it mentions Simuka's name, but not that of Krishna. Based on this, multiple historians conclude that Satakarni was Simuka's son, and succeeded Krishna. G. V. Rao, however, believes that the inscription is that of a different king Satakarni II; Simuka is mentioned in the inscription as the founder of the dynasty. .

02/16/2024 01:23:54 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: In the 19th century, fake moustaches held associations with deception and criminality. Lewis Powell, one of the conspirators in the Lincoln assassination plot, carried with him a fake moustache during his assassination attempt on William H. Seward. A key witness, Louis J. Weichmann, commented that he "thought no honest person had a reason to wear a false mustache."  Despite these perceptions, false facial hair was worn for aesthetic reasons during the Victorian era, as facial hair was particularly fashionable during this period.  In the mid-20th century, fake mustaches were sold commercially. The New York Herald Tribune reported in 1963 that customers were primarily "young boys for fun or to 'virilize' themselves" as well as "wives who give them to their husbands."  During the 2010s, fake moustaches surged in popularity, as a humorous, ironic, and retro motif.  Cultural significance  In many forms of popular media, the use of a fake moustache as an unconvincing disguise is a commonly-used trope. The "disguised face" emoji (🥸) features a fake moustache, as well as a pair of glasses.  Drawn-on fake moustaches are deployed humorously in graffiti and other artistic means. Marcel Duchamp's artwork L.H.O.O.Q. depicts the Mona Lisa with a moustache. In the 1946 cartoon Daffy Doodles, Daffy Duck draws fake moustaches on everyone she sees. .

By the time of the eighth-century Abbasid Caliphate however, the meaning of the word zindīq and the adjectival zandaqa had broadened and could loosely denote many things: Gnostic Dualists as well as followers of Manichaeism, agnostics, and atheists. However, many of those persecuted for zandaqa under the Abbasids claimed to be Muslims, and when applied to Muslims, the accusation was that the accused secretly harbored Manichaean beliefs. "The proof for such an accusation was sought, if at all, in an indication of some kind of dualism, or if that individual openly flouted Islamic beliefs or practices." As such, certain Muslim poets of early Abbasid times could thus also be accused of zandaqa as much as an actual Manichaean might. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

He was particularly prominent during Later Jin, when he served as chief of staff (Shumishi) and chancellor.  During Later Han, he was falsely accused of treason and executed.  Background  It is not known when Li Song was born, but it is known that he was from Raoyang (饒陽, in modern Hengshui, Hebei).  His father Li Shunqing () was the tactical officer at Shen Prefecture (深州, in modern Hengshui), which Raoyang belonged to.  He had at least two younger brothers, Li Yu () and Li Yi (李㠖). Li Shunqing was a descendant of Li Lin (李𬭸). Li Lin said to be 6th generation descendant of Li Yuanyi, Prince Zhenghui (鄭惠王, 李元懿), who was a 13th son of Emperor Gaozu of Tang. It was said that he was intelligent in his youth, and was writing artful texts even when he was in his teenage years, surprising his family members.

How to interpret gutanio remains a matter of some dispute among runologists, however (Nedoma 2003).  Spearhead of Kovel  The head of a lance, found in 1858 Suszyczno, 30 km from Kovel, Ukraine, dated to the early 3rd century.  The spearhead measures 15.5 cm with a maximal width of 3.0 cm. Both sides of the leaf were inlaid with silver symbols. The inscription notably runs right to left, reading tilarids, interpreted as "thither rider" or more likely, as suggested by Prof. Johannes Hoops (Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde, Volume 17), "Ziel-Reiter" (mod. German: "target rider" = sure hitter, perhaps a case of wishful thinking), the name either of a warrior, or of the spear itself. It is identified as East Germanic (Gothic) because of the nominative -s (in contrast to Proto-Norse -z). The t and d are closer to the Latin alphabet than to the classical Elder Futhark, as it were <>.  An 1880 casting of the spearhead is exhibited in Berlin, an 1884 casting in Warsaw.

Taylor suggests a range from 210 to 250. In more recent studies, scholars have proposed slightly later dates, with supporters of the Athanaric theory suggesting the end of the 4th century, the date also proposed by Constantinescu, and Tomescu suggesting the early 5th century.  Inscription  Reconstruction and interpretation  The gold ring bears an Elder Futhark runic inscription of 15 characters, with the 7th (probably ᛟ /o/) having been mostly destroyed when the ring was cut in half by thieves. The damaged rune has been the object of some scholarly debate, and is variously interpreted as indicating ᛃ /j/ (Reichert 1993, Nedoma 1993) or possibly ᛋ /s/ (Looijenga 1997). If the photograph of the Arundel Society is to be taken as a guide, then the inscription originally read as follows:  gutaniowi hailag  This reading was followed by early scholars, notably Taylor, who translates "dedicated to the temple of the Goths", and Diculescu (1923), who translates "sacred (hailag) to the Jove (iowī, i.e. Thor) of the Goths". Düwel (2001), commenting upon the same reading, suggests interpreting ᛟ as indicative of ō[þal] thus:. Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

Other scholars have interpreted the ᛟ as indicative of a feminine ending: Johnsen (1971) translates "the holy relic (= the [altar] ring) of Gutaniō"; Krogmann (1978), reading ᛗ /m/ for ᚹᛁ /wi/, translates "dedicated to the Gothic Mothers (= female guardian spirits of the Goths)"; Antonsen (2002) translates "Sacrosanct of Gothic women/female warriors". Construing the damaged rune as ᛋ /s/, Looijenga (1997) reads:  gutanīs wī[h] hailag  She comments that gutanīs should be understood as an early form of Gothic gutaneis, "Gothic", and wī[h] as early Gothic weih, "sanctuary". Following this reading, she translates the whole inscription "Gothic (object). Sacrosanct." Reichert (1993) suggests that it is also possible to read the damaged rune as ᛃ /j/, and interprets it as representative of j[ēra], thus:  gutanī j[era] wī[h] hailag  Reichert translates this as "(good) year of the Goths, sacred (and) inviolable hailag". Though Düwel (2001) has expressed doubts regarding the meaning of such a statement, Nordgren (2004) supports Reichert's reading, viewing the ring as connected to a sacral king in his role of ensuring an abundant harvest (represented by ᛃ jera). Pieper (2003) reads the damaged rune as ᛝ /ŋ/, thus:  gutanī [i(ng)]wi[n] hailag . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

In 218, he started a rebellion with several others in the imperial capital, Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan), but the revolt was suppressed and the conspirators were captured and executed.  Error in name Ji Ben's given name was actually "Pi" (). His name is believed to have been erroneously recorded as "Ben" () in historical texts to avoid naming taboo, because "Pi" was the personal name of Cao Pi, the first ruler of the Cao Wei state. Besides, the Chinese character for "Pi" might have actually been 㔻 instead of 丕. There were instances where 㔻 had been mistakenly written as 丕.  Life Ji Ben served as a court physician (太醫令) in the imperial court of the Eastern Han dynasty during the reign of Emperor Xian (). Around the time, the Han central government had fallen under the control of Cao Cao, the Imperial Chancellor. Emperor Xian was merely a figurehead ruler. In 216, Emperor Xian granted Cao Cao the title of a vassal king – King of Wei (魏王) – and allowed him to establish a vassal kingdom in northern China which was still nominally under the Han administration. .

Early studies erroneously assumed that the beginning of the letter concerned the activities of Tawagalawa.

Piyamaradu is also mentioned in the Manapa-Tarhunta letter (c. 1295 BC) and, in the past tense, in the Milawata letter (c. 1240 BC).

In its simplest form, an arrow is a triangle, chevron, or concave kite, usually affixed to a line segment or rectangle, and in more complex forms a representation of an actual arrow (e.g. ➵ U+27B5). The direction indicated by an arrow is the one along the length of the line or rectangle toward the single pointed end.  History An older (medieval) convention is  the  manicule (pointing hand, 👈). Pedro Reinel in c. 1504 first used the  fleur-de-lis as indicating north in a compass rose;  the convention of marking the eastern direction with a cross is older (medieval). Use of the arrow symbol does not appear to pre-date the 18th century. An early arrow symbol is found in an illustration of Bernard Forest de Bélidor's treatise L'architecture hydraulique, printed in France in 1737. The arrow is here used to illustrate the direction of the flow of water and of the water wheel's rotation. At about the same time, arrow symbols were used to indicate the flow of rivers in maps. .

In response, Bayanchur's grandfather Yaoluoge Hushu (藥羅葛護輸) - the nephew of Yaoluoge Chengzong, ambushed Wang Junchuo and killed him, and while Yaoluoge Hushu was forced to flee thereafter, for several years the Tang Dynasty did not engage in any offensive campaigns in the region. 14 year old Bayanchur and his brothers had to follow his grandfather into exile..

The course of the Aksu is between the Düden to the west and of the Köprüçay to the east. It discharges into the Mediterranean near the city of Antalya. The river is about 145 km long and has a total catchment area of 3652 km². There are several lakes in its catchment area, including Lake Kovada and the reservoirs created by the Karacaören-1 and Karacaören-2 Dams.  The Aksu is primarily fed by karstic springs in the Taurus Mountains. In contrast to the many seasonal streams in the region, the Aksu flows year-round, although its volume can fluctuate dramatically throughout the year. For example, its flow was measured in 1942 to be 250 m³/s in January and 7.5 m³/s during the summer. Like other karstic streams, the Aksu does not carry much sediment with it. .

Kætil/Ketill was probably one of the most common male names in Old Norse times. In Landnámabók, it is the male name that occurs most often - even more frequently than the most widely used compositions with Tor-. There are 44 found runic inscriptions from the Viking era that contain the name Kætill, which is why it is the 13th most used male name in this material. Five of the inscriptions are found in Denmark and three in Norway, most others have unknown sites. The name was most often written with runes like ᚲᛖᛏᛁᛚ (ketil), ᚲᛁᛏᛁᛚ (kitil) or ᚲᚨᛏᛁᛚ (katil).  In Denmark the name appears in many village (torp) names, so there are nearly 20 places named Kelstrup or Kjelstrup. However, the name does not appear in compositions with -lev, and it can only be explained that it was not used at the time when -lev names were formed. Consequently, we can date the period when Kætil/Ketill was used as a name, at the time between the end of the Migration Period and the beginning of the Viking Age. But the reason that the name gained such tremendous prevalence within a few centuries, we do not know. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

Etymology Haošyaŋha is the Avestan development of Proto-Iranian *Haušyahah, containing the prefix *Hau-, a derived form of *Hu-, 'good, well', and an uncertain root šyah-, possibly to be interpreted as 'selecting' or 'deciding'. The name might then be interpreted as meaning 'of the good choice'.  Haošyaŋha in Zoroastrian literature  Haošyaŋha's original status is uncertain.  He may have begun as a demon-defeating hero, or may have been a rival for the title of first man (or first king) with Gayōmart.  He is also considered his successor in the line of mythical primordial kings of the Pishdadian dynasty.  The Reign of Hushang  The just and prudent Hushang was now master of the world, and he set the crown on his head and ruled in his grandfather's place. He reigned for forty years, and his mind was filled with wisdom, his heart with justice. Sitting on the royal throne, he said, “From this throne I rule over the seven climes, and everywhere my commands are obeyed."

Except for legendary rulers and the Sinitic-speaking Zhao dynasty and the Early Ly dynasty, the most popular and common Vietnamese designation for ruler, vua 𪼀 (lit. sovereign, chieftain), according to Liam C. Kelley, is "largely based on a pure semantic association based on the benevolent feature associated to the 'father' (but, on the other hand, the image of the father may also be terrifying, strict, or even mean)." Because there is no elaborated Chinese character or any attempt to standardize the Sino-Vietnamese Chữ Nôm script to render vua, the title was rendered in different ways. Vua in Ancient Vietnamese (10th–15th centuries) is attested in the 14th-century Buddhist literature Việt Điện U Linh Tập as bùgài (布蓋) in Chinese or vua cái (great sovereign in Vietnamese), in 15th-century Buddhist scripture Phật thuyết đại báo phụ mẫu ân trọng kinh as sībù (司布); in Middle Vietnamese (16th–17th centuries) as ꞗua or bua; becoming vua in Early Modern Vietnamese (18-19th centuries) such as recorded by Alexis-Marie de Rochon's A Voyage to Madagascar and the East Indies.

The text, which appears in Yasna 27.13, is also known after its opening words yatha ahu vairyo. In Zoroastrian tradition, the formula is also known as the ahun(a)war.  Numerous translations and interpretations exist, but the overall meaning of the text remains obscure. The Ahuna Vairya and Ashem Vohu (the second most sacred formula at Yasna 27.14) are together "very cryptic formulas, of a pronounced magical character." The Ahunavaiti Gatha (chapters 28-34 of the Yasna), is named after the Ahuna Vairya formula.  In relation to the other formulas Like the other three formulas (Ashem vohu, Yenghe hatam, Airyaman ishya), the Ahuna Vairya is part of the Gathic canon, that is, part of the group of texts composed in the more archaic dialect of the Avestan language. Together with the other three formulas, the Ahuna Vairya is part of the 'envelope' that liturgically encloses the Gathas, i.e. the hymns attributed to Zoroaster. One of the formulas, the Airyaman ishya (Yasna 54.1) follows the Gathas, while the other three formulas – Ahuna Vairya, Ashem vohu and Yenghe hatam (together at Yasna 27.13-27.15) – precede them. .

02/16/2024 01:53:59 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 2 unknown glyphs in sentence: Scholars have advanced a number of theories on the origin of the nomina sacra. Biblical scholar Larry Hurtado has suggested Greek numerals as the origin of the overline spanning the nomen sacrum, with , the ordinary way of writing "18", being taken as reminiscent of a suspended form of ΙΗΣΟΥΣ (Jesus). In some Greek Scripture manuscripts the Hebrew tetragrammaton (transliterated as YHWH) is found unabbreviated in the Greek text. The Septuagint manuscript Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 1007 even uses an abbreviated form of the tetragrammaton: two Greek zetas with a horizontal line through the middle, imitating two Paleo-Hebrew yodhs (𐤉‬𐤉).  Greek culture also employed a number of ways of abbreviating even proper names, though none in quite the same form as the nomina sacra. Inspiration for the contracted forms (using the first and last letter) has also been seen in Revelation, where Jesus speaks of himself as "the beginning and the end" and "the first and the last" as well "the Alpha and the Omega". .

02/16/2024 01:54:12 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 3 unknown glyphs in sentence: Oettingen and Riemann both conceived of the relationships in the chart being defined through just intonation, which uses pure intervals. One can extend out one of the horizontal rows of the Tonnetz indefinitely, to form a never-ending sequence of perfect fifths: F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F♯-C♯-G♯-D♯-A♯-E♯-B♯-F𝄪-C𝄪-G𝄪- (etc.) Starting with F, after 12 perfect fifths, one reaches E♯. Perfect fifths in just intonation are slightly larger than the compromised fifths used in equal temperament tuning systems more common in the present. This means that when one stacks 12 fifths starting from F, the E♯ we arrive at will not be seven octaves above the F we started with. Oettingen and Riemann's Tonnetz thus extended on infinitely in every direction without actually repeating any pitches. In the twentieth century, composer-theorists such as Ben Johnston and James Tenney continued to developed theories and applications involving just-intoned Tonnetze. .

He succeeded king Niqmaddu II.  Very little is known about his short reign, as he is only mentioned in six juridical texts. The one that gives the most information about him is his 'Last will', where he warns his brothers not to marry his wife Kubaba after his death, contrary to the levirate custom. The intriguing letter gave room to plenty of speculation about him, with his non-Semitic name that stands out amongst all Ugaritan kings further enhancing the mystery, with some even suggesting that he was not the legitimate heir to the throne.  Later on, he was supposedly forced by the Hittite king Mursili II to abdicate the throne, in favour of his brother, Niqmepa. He was probably sent to exile afterwards.

Ammurapi was a contemporary of the Hittite King Suppiluliuma II. He wrote a preserved vivid letter RS 18.147 (Nougayrol et al. (1968 Ugaritica V): 87-9 no. 24) in response to a plea for assistance from the king of Alashiya.  Ammurapi wrote:  This letter dramatically highlights the desperate situation facing Ugarit while it was also under attack by the invading Sea Peoples.  Ugarit would become one of the many states of the ancient Near East that were destroyed or abandoned during the Bronze Age collapse.  Suppiluliuma II was responsible for the divorce settlement between Ammurapi and a Hittite woman, but it did not cause a problem between the Kingdom of Ugarit and the Hittite Empire; instead it demonstrated the relationship between both kingdoms.

In July 2006, various European and Asian rights organizations participated in coordinated demonstrations held outside Iran's embassies and consulate offices in different cities. In a number of public statements, the protesting organizations condemned stoning executions as a crime against humanity, demanded immediate and unconditional clemency for Malak Ghorbany, and called upon the Iranian regime to permanently ban stoning sentences. .

02/16/2024 02:11:50 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: According to the standard biographical dictionary of Egyptology, "Kircher has become, perhaps unfairly, the symbol of all that is absurd and fantastic in the story of the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs". Kircher thought the Egyptians had believed in an ancient theological tradition that preceded and foreshadowed Christianity, and he hoped to understand this tradition through hieroglyphs. Like his Renaissance predecessors, he believed hieroglyphs represented an abstract form of communication rather than a language. To translate such a system of communication in a self-consistent way was impossible. Therefore, in his works on hieroglyphs, such as Oedipus Aegyptiacus (1652–1655), Kircher proceeded by guesswork based on his understanding of ancient Egyptian beliefs, derived from the Coptic texts he had read and from ancient texts that he thought contained traditions derived from Egypt. His translations turned short texts containing only a few hieroglyphic characters into lengthy sentences of esoteric ideas. Unlike earlier European scholars, Kircher did realise that hieroglyphs could function phonetically, though he considered this function a late development. He also recognised one hieroglyph, 𓈗, as representing water and thus standing phonetically for the Coptic word for water, mu, as well as the m sound. He became the first European to correctly identify a phonetic value for a hieroglyph.. Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

02/16/2024 02:16:36 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 2 unknown glyphs in sentence: The relationship and origins of the Cumans and Kipchaks is uncertain. Probably, Cumans and Kipchaks had originally been two distinct Turkic peoples who joined one same confederation, with Cumans constituting the western part and Kipchaks the eastern part. According to Rashid al-Din Hamadani, writing much later in the Ilkhanate, Kipchak is derived from a Turkic word which means 'hollow rotted out tree'. Cuman may be derived from the Turkic word , which means 'pale' or 'yellow". Some scholars associate the Cumans-Kipchaks with the Kankalis. The Kipchaks might have been mentioned as Turk-Kibchak in the 8th century Moyun Chur inscription, though this was uncertain as only the letters 𐰲𐰴 (čq *čaq?) were readable on the damaged inscription; they were first definitely mentioned in the 9th century by Ibn Khordadbeh, who placed them next to the Toquz Oghuz, while Al-Biruni claimed that the Qun were further east of them. Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi writes that the Qun came from the lands of Cathay which they fled from in fear of the Khitans.

02/16/2024 02:18:27 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 2 unknown glyphs in sentence: Street Angel constructed a theatrical-style mise-en-scène by using the distinctive element of a back alley, known as a lilong (⾥弄) or a longtang (弄堂) in Shanghai. Lilongs are a typical architectural feature in Shanghai that can be dated back to the city's founding. Due to the planned design of the city, people's gazes directed the viewer's attention from a higher position to a lower position as the houses were built on two levels. The lower floor became the focus, as they are the object of the woman's gaze in the illustration. This type of composition can be seen in periodicals from the 1880s onwards, as well as in collections such as 'An Illustrated Explanation of Local Customs' (⾵俗志圖說,) and 'A Hundred Beauties of Shanghai' (海上百艷圖,). The theater is used as a model to represent the urban streets and alleys of Shanghai. People's downward gaze from the box seats is similar to that of the characters in the picture: overlooking alleys from the second floor. Therefore, Shanghai's alleys are fundamentally theatrical in nature. In Street Angel, the setting enhances the mise-en-scène in the way that it features people leaning out of windows and watching alleys. When the shot returns to the balcony, it signals the narrative beginning. Many shots in Street Angel are from second-storey windows, reminding viewers of the composition of the lithographed illustration and the view from the box seats in stage theaters. Also, the shots between Xiao Hong and Xiao Chen's second-floor rooms maintain the practice of theatrical spectatorship. The equal attention devoted between Xiao Hong and Xiao Chen, which is created by a 180 pan, is similar to the exchanges between men and women in box seats in the theater. Lighting plays a huge role in Shanghai theater where the light source and strength of light portrays different emotions, thus supplementing the actors, Ni Yi states. Xiao Hong is shown in the dark in Street Angel, which portrays him as feeling morose. “Left-leaning theater activity”, states Tarryn Li-Min Chun, “is mostly taken out into the streets and tailoring its exigencies of political transformation than on stage techniques. Street Angel, also being a left-wing movie, follows suit with having most of the scenes out in the street.. Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

It was called Telebehi in the Lycian language. The well-protected harbor of Telmessos is separated from the Gulf of Telmessos by an island.  The name of the modern town on the site is Fethiye.  History  The city was known as Kuwalapašša by the Hittites and Telebehi by the Lycians. According to the annals of Hattusili III, the city was a part of Lycia (which was known as Lukka at the time) and conquered by the Hittites. Another Hittite document mentions the cities of Kuwalapašša and Dalawa sent aid to Hittites during the war against Iyalanda.   Telmessos was a flourishing city in the west of Lycia, on the Gulf of Fethiye. It was famed for its school of diviners, consulted among others by the Lydian king Croesus, prior to declaring war against Cyrus, and by Alexander the Great, when he came to the town after the siege of Halicarnassus.

Its capitals were Tushpa and later Erebuni.  History  Orontid dynasty   The Orontid dynasty, or known by their native name, Eruandid or Yervanduni, was an Iranian hereditary dynasty that ruled the satrapy of Armenia, the successor state to the Iron Age kingdom of Urartu (Ararat). It is suggested that it held dynastic familial linkages to the ruling Achaemenid dynasty. Throughout their existence, the Orontids stressed their lineage from the Achaemenids to strengthen their political legitimacy.  Members of the dynasty ruled Armenia intermittently during the period spanning from the 6th to at least the 2nd centuries BC, first as client kings or satraps of the Median and Achaemenid empires and later, after the collapse of the Achaemenid empire, as rulers of an independent kingdom, and later as kings of Sophene and Commagene, which eventually succumbed to the Roman Empire. .

Most of the letters resemble letters of the Greek alphabet, but their sound values are generally unrelated to the values of the Greek letters. This is unusual among the alphabets of Asia Minor, which generally approximate the Greek alphabet fairly well, both in sound and shape, apart from sounds which had no equivalent in Greek. However, the Carian sound values are not completely disconnected: 𐊠  (Greek Α), 𐊫  (Greek Ο), 𐊰  (Greek Ϻ san), and 𐊲  (Greek Υ) are as close to Greek as any Anatolian alphabet, and 𐊷, which resembles Greek Β, has the similar sound , which it shares with Greek-derived Lydian 𐤡. .

02/16/2024 02:21:51 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 17 unknown glyphs in sentence: Adiego (2007) therefore suggests that the original Carian script was adopted from cursive Greek, and that it was later restructured, perhaps for monumental inscription, by imitating the form of the most graphically similar Greek print letters without considering their phonetic values. Thus a , which in its cursive form may have had a curved top, was modeled after Greek qoppa (Ϙ) rather than its ancestral tau (Τ) to become 𐊭. Carian , from archaic Greek 𐌌, would have been simplified and was therefore closer in shape to Greek Ν than Μ when it was remodeled as 𐊪. Indeed, many of the regional variants of Carian letters parallel Greek variants: 𐊥  are common graphic variants of digamma, 𐊨 ʘ of theta, 𐊬 Λ of both gamma and lambda, 𐌓 𐊯 𐌃 of rho, 𐊵 𐊜 of phi, 𐊴 𐊛 of chi, 𐊲 V of upsilon, and 𐋏 𐊺 parallel Η 𐌇 eta. This could also explain why one of the rarest letters, 𐊱, has the form of one of the most common Greek letters. However, no such proto-Carian cursive script is attested, so these etymologies are speculative.  Further developments occurred within each script; in Kaunos, for example, it would seem that 𐊮  and 𐊭  both came to resemble a Latin P, and so were distinguished with an extra line in one: 𐌓 , 𐊯 .

02/16/2024 02:21:51 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 21 unknown glyphs in sentence: The British Egyptologist John D. Ray apparently worked independently from Kowalski; nevertheless he produced similar results (1981, 1983). He used Carian–Egyptian bilingual inscriptions that had been neglected until then. His big breakthrough was the reading of the name Psammetichus (Egyptian Pharaoh) in Carian.  The radically different values that Ray assigned to the letters initially met with scepticism. Ignasi-Xavier Adiego, along with Diether Schürr, started to contribute to the project in the early 1990s. In his 1993 book Studia Carica, Adiego offered the decipherment values for letters that are now known as the ‘Ray-Schürr-Adiego system’. This system now gained wider acceptance.

Representing this concept is the divinity Verethragna, who is the hypostasis of "victory", and "as a giver of victory Verethragna plainly enjoyed the greatest popularity of old." In Zoroastrian Middle Persian, Verethragna became 𐭥𐭫𐭧𐭫𐭠𐭭 Warahrām, from which Vahram, Vehram, Bahram, Behram and other variants derive.  The word has a cognate in Vedic Sanskrit.

Master Kung: The Story of Confucius (1937),  Time magazine wrote that to "orthodox Confucians Author Crow's Confucius may sometimes seem confusing. But they will have to admit that he succeeds in peeling off a lot of the 24-century coating of official lacquer. In fact, as Author Crow portrays him, the huge, ugly wise man emerges with a look as human as Benjamin Franklin's." This was followed by the anecdotal The Chinese are Like That (1938), titled My Friends the Chinese in England.  Crow's most popular book, 400 Million Customers (1937), won one of the early National Book Awards: the Most Original Book of 1937, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. The book argued that foreign businessmen had to listen to their Chinese customers to meet their surprising but ultimately comprehensible requests. Chinese were customers, not bosses. The book has been reprinted at least twice in the new millennium. The historian Jerry Israel, however, wrote that Crows China had no misery, wretchedness, poverty or . . . revolution.

In 1882, Michael Cusack attended the first meeting of the 'Dublin Hurling Club', formed "for the purpose of taking steps to re-establish the national game of hurling". In September 1883, Cusack began to organise hurling practices in Phoenix Park on Saturday afternoons. The game had long been lost to the city and to most of the remaining parts of the country as well. As a consequence, just four men turned up on that first Saturday. Slowly the numbers grew, with intrigued spectators joining in. Eventually, Cusack had sufficient numbers to found 'Cusack's Academy Hurling Club' which, in turn, led to the establishment of the Metropolitan Hurling Club. Cusack then established a hurling club in his school on Gardiner Place in October 1883. Immediately, the two clubs began to play matches against each other. A report, written by Cusack, records a game played in December 1883: "During the third and fourth quarters the hurling became so fast and furious, the goals were so threatened on the one hand and defended on the other, that spectators expected to be called on after each charge to help the disabled to Steevens Hospital." On Easter Monday 1884, the Metropolitans played Killimor, in Galway. The game had to be stopped on numerous occasions as the two teams were playing to different rules. It was this clash of styles that convinced Cusack that not only did the rules of the games need to be standardised, but that a body must be established to govern Irish sports..

He insisted that "musical talent is subject to scientific analysis and can be measured."  To perform such measurements, Seashore and his colleagues constructed various devices, including an audiometer, to measure auditory acuity.  He went on to devise a set of measures in 1919 that involved controlled procedures for measuring a respondent's ability to discriminate pitch, loudness, tempo, timbre, and rhythm.  Seashore incorporated complex machinery, systems of pulleys to generate reproducible pitches, and a special set of tuning forks to test pitch discrimination, dissonance, rhythm, melodic memory, and music intensity. .

This transfer coding method also allows additional entity header fields to be sent after the last chunk if the client specified the "trailers" parameter as an argument of the TE field. The origin server of the response can also decide to send additional entity trailers even if the client did not specify the "trailers" option in the TE request field, but only if the metadata is optional (i.e. the client can use the received entity without them). Whenever the trailers are used, the server should list their names in the Trailer header field; three header field types are specifically prohibited from appearing as a trailer field:  Transfer-Encoding, Content-Length and Trailer.  Format If a  field with a value of "" is specified in an HTTP message (either a request sent by a client or the response from the server), the body of the message consists of one or more chunks and one terminating chunk with an optional trailer before the final ␍␊ sequence (i.e. carriage return followed by line feed). .

The terminating chunk is a special chunk of zero length. It may contain a trailer, which consists of a (possibly empty) sequence of entity header fields. Normally, such header fields would be sent in the message's header; however, it may be more efficient to determine them after processing the entire message entity.

02/16/2024 02:37:12 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 5 unknown glyphs in sentence: Numismatic evidence from Sicily shows that some western Phoenicians made use of the term "Phoinix", but it is not clear what term (if any) they used for themselves; they may have called themselves 𐤊𐤍𐤏𐤍𐤌 (, "Canaanites"). A passage from Augustine has often been interpreted as indicating that they called themselves Canaanites ( in Latin language), Augustine writes:  "When our rural peasants are asked what they are, they reply, in Punic, Chanani, which is only a corruption by one letter of the alphabet of what we would expect: What else should they reply except that they are Chananei?". It has been argued by J.C. Quinn that this is a misreading, since although this term is "applied to Levantine people" in the Hebrew Bible, "there is no other evidence for self-identification as Canaanite, and so we might suspect him of learned optimism." However, this opinion is not shared by all scholars.   In modern academic writing, the term Punic exclusively refers to Phoenicians in the western Mediterranean. Specific Punic groups are often referred to with hyphenated names, like Siculo-Punic or Sardo-Punic. (This practice has ancient roots: Hellenistic Greek authors sometimes referred to the Punic inhabitants of central northern Africa (Libya) as Liby-Phoenicians.)  Overview.

Its call or chirp rather resembles the sound "gecko, gecko". However, this is an interpretation, and the sound may also be described as "tchak tchak tchak" (often sounded six to nine times in sequence). In Asia, notably Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia in the south east, geckos have local names onomatopoetically derived from the sounds they make: Hemidactylus frenatus is called "chee chak" or "chi chak" (pr- chee chuck), said quickly, also commonly spelled as "cicak" in Malay dictionaries. In the Philippines, they are called "butiki" in Tagalog, "tiki" in Visayan, "alutiit" in Ilocano, and in Thailand, "jing-jok" (). In Myanmar, they are called "အိမ်မြှောင် - ain-mjong" ( "အိမ် - ain" means "house" and "မြှောင် - mjong" means "stick to").  In some parts of India and in Pakistan, they are called "chhipkali" (Urdu:چھپکلی, Hindi: छिपकली), from chhipkana, to stick. In Nepal, they are called "vhitti" (Nepali: भित्ती)  or "mausuli" (Nepali: माउसुली).

History  Origins  The Scythians originated in Central Asia possibly around the 9th century BC, and they arrived in the Caucasian Steppe in the 8th and 7th centuries BC as part of a significant movement of the nomadic peoples of the Eurasian Steppe. This movement started when another nomadic Iranian tribe closely related to the Scythians, either the Massagetae or the Issedones, migrated westwards, forcing the Early Scythians to the west across the Araxes river, following which the Scythians moved into the Caspian Steppe, where they conquered the territory of the Cimmerians, who were also a nomadic Iranian people closely related to the Scythians, and assimilated most of them while displacing the rest, before settling in the area between the Araxes, the Caucasus Mountains and the Lake Maeotis. .

It was east of the Tigris River on the border between Sumer and Elam. At one time it was thought that it might have been ancient Durum but more recent scholarship has rebutted that.  History Der was occupied from the Early Dynastic period through Neo-Assyrian times. The local deity of the city was named Ishtaran, represented on Earth by his minister, the snake god Nirah. In the late 3rd millennium, during the reign of Sulgi of the Third Dynasty of Ur, Der was mentioned twice. The Sulgi year name 11 was named "Year Ishtaran of Der was brought into his temple", and year 21 was named "Year Der was destroyed". During the time of Amar-Sin, when the king launched a long military campaign against Huhnuri, prince Shu-Sin, crown prince, left his post in Der to return and hold Ur. In the second millennium, Der was mentioned in a tablet discovered at Mari sent by Yarim-Lim I of Yamhad; the tablet includes a reminder to Yasub-Yahad king of Der about the military help given to him for fifteen years by Yarim-Lim, followed by a declaration of war against the city in retaliation for what Yarim-Lim described as evil deeds committed by Yasub-Yahad. .

02/16/2024 02:43:36 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 6 unknown glyphs in sentence: The Palmer notation consists of a symbol (⏌⎿ ⏋⎾) designating in which quadrant the tooth is found and a number indicating the position from the midline. Adult teeth are numbered 1 to 8, with deciduous (baby) teeth indicated by a letter A to E. Hence the left and right maxillary central incisor would have the same number, "1", but the right one would have the symbol  "⏌" underneath it, while the left one would have "⎿".

The designations "left" and "right" on the chart, however, nonetheless correspond to the patient's left and right, respectively.  One advantage of Palmer notation is that it can produce a very graphical image, akin to a 'map' of the dentition; tooth transpositions or edentulous spaces can easily be depicted if desired. It would also be feasible to introduce additional alphabetic characters or other symbols, for example to denote supernumerary teeth or bridge pontics, to which a purely numerical method such as the FDI system does not lend itself easily.

02/16/2024 02:44:56 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 5 unknown glyphs in sentence: É (Cuneiform: ) is the Sumerian word or symbol for house or temple.  The Sumerian term É.GAL  (𒂍𒃲,"palace", literally "big house") denoted a city's main building. É.LUGAL (𒂍𒈗,"king's house") was used synonymously. In the texts of Lagash, the É.GAL is the center of the ensi's administration of the city, and the site of the city archives. Sumerian É.GAL is the probable etymology of Semitic words for "palace, temple", such as Hebrew היכל heikhal, and Arabic هيكل haykal. It has thus been speculated that the word É originated from something akin to *hai or *ˀai, especially since the cuneiform sign È is used for /a/ in Eblaite.  The term TEMEN (𒋼) appearing frequently after É in names of ziggurats is translated as "foundation pegs", apparently the first step in the construction process of a house; compare, for example, verses 551–561 of the account of the construction of E-ninnu:  Temen has been occasionally compared to Greek temenos "holy precinct", but the latter has a well established Indo-European etymology (from *temə- meaning to cut). .

In writing  NIN originated as a ligature of the cuneiform glyphs of MUNUS () and TÚG (); the NIN sign was written as MUNUS.TÚG () in archaic cuneiform, notably in the Codex Hammurabi. The syllable nin, on the other hand, was written as MUNUS.KA () in Assyrian cuneiform. MUNUS.KU = NIN9 () means "sister".  Occurrence in the Gilgamesh epic  Ninsun (DNIN.SÚN) as the mother of Gilgamesh in the Epic of Gilgamesh (standard Babylonian version), appears in 5 of the 12 chapters (tablets I, II, III, IV, and XII). The other personage using NIN is the god Ninurta (DNIN.URTA), who appears in Tablet I, and especially in the flood myth of Tablet XI. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

Originally, it seems to have been used to designate a high priest or priestess of a Sumerian city-state's patron-deity – a position that entailed political power as well. It may also have been the original title of the ruler of Uruk. See Lugal, ensi and en for more details.  Deities including En as part of their name include DEnlil, DEnki, DEngurun, and DEnzu.  Enheduanna, Akkadian 2285 BC – 2250 BC was the first known holder of the title, "En Priestess."  Archaic forms  The corresponding Emesal dialect word was UMUN, which may preserve an archaic form of the word. Earlier Emeg̃ir (the standard dialect of Sumerian) forms can be postulated as *ewen or *emen, eventually dropping the middle consonant and becoming the familiar EN.  Amarna letters: bêlu The 1350 BC Amarna letters use EN for bêlu, though not exclusively. The more common spelling is mostly 'be' + 'li', to make "bêlí", or its equivalent. Some example letters using cuneiform 'EN' are letters EA (for 'El Amarna') 252, EA 254, and EA 282, titled: "A demand for recognition", by Abimilku; "Neither rebel or delinquent (2)", by Labayu; and "Alone", by Shuwardata.

02/16/2024 02:49:29 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 5 unknown glyphs in sentence: Cuneiform TI or TÌL (Borger 2003 nr. ; U+122FE 𒋾) has the main meaning of "life" when used ideographically. The written sign developed from the drawing of an arrow, since the words meaning "arrow" and "life" were pronounced similarly in the Sumerian language.  With the determinative UZU 𒍜 "flesh, meat", UZUTI, it means "rib". This homophony is exploited in the myth of Ninti (𒊩𒌆𒋾 NIN.TI "lady of life" or "lady of the rib"), created by Ninhursag to cure the ailing Enki. Since Eve is called "mother of life" in Genesis, together with her being taken from Adam's  tsela` "side, rib", the story of Adam and Eve has sometimes been considered to derive from that of Ninti.  In Akkadian orthography, the sign has the syllabic values di or ṭi, in Hittite ti, di or te.

As the hypostasis of "reward," "recompense," or "capricious luck," Ashi is also a divinity in the Zoroastrian hierarchy of yazatas.  Nomenclature Avestan 'ashi' is a feminine abstract noun, deriving from the root ar-, "to allot," with a substantivizing -ta suffix, hence aṣ̌i/arti "that which is granted." In the Avesta, the term implies both material and spiritual recompense.  Although conceptually older than Zoroastrianism, Ashi has no attested equivalent in Vedic Sanskrit.

The basic story goes as follows: Four entered the pardes—Ben Azzai, Ben Zoma, Ben Avuya (called אחר - acher, the other one - because of what happened to him after he entered the pardes) and Rabbi Akiva. One looked and died; one looked and went mad; one looked and apostatized; and one entered in peace and departed in peace.Sources differ with regard to which sage died and which became demented; the Tosefta and Bavli say ben-Azai died and ben-Zoma became demented, but the Yerushalmi, Shir HaShirim Rabbah, and Hekhalot literature record the inverse.

His name has Sumerian origin and can be translated as "syrup man."  In the second and first millennium BCE, Lulal evolved into an anthropomorphic god/demon used on protective amulets, figurines and exorcists’ paraphernalia used in apotropaic rituals, such as Šurpu and Maqlu, usually displayed alongside Ugallu, “Big Weather Beast”, the lion-headed demon, or with his Akkadian alter-ego Lātarāk.

02/16/2024 02:57:18 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: The earliest known member of the Hecatomnid family was the dynast Hyssaldomus. He was the father of Hecatomnus, better known as the founder of the dynasty, and a woman named Aba, who may also have been the mother of Hecatomnus' children. He may have been the first satrap of Caria before his son Hecatomnus, as has been suggested by Louis Robert, although there is no conclusive evidence that this was the case. Several silver coins may have been struck by Hyssaldomus in his capacity as the dynast of Mylasa; these coins have typical Mylasan iconography, but are marked with the Carian letters Ш (w) or 𐋐 (y), which may stand for the unknown equivalent of Hyssaldomus' name in the Carian language.  The Hecatomnids were therefore one of many minor dynasties in Caria. Their seat was originally Mylasa, a major city in central Caria. The family may have gained control of the city when Heracleides of Mylasa fled Caria after the Ionian Revolt. Herodotus records how, during the Ionian Revolt, the dynasts of Cindye included a Mausolus and a Pixodarus. The reuse of those names by later members of the Hecatomnid dynasty suggests that the same family which ruled Mylasa at the start of the fourth century BCE previously ruled Kindye at the start of the fifth, and moved from the smaller town to the larger city at some point before they became satraps of Caria. .

Cherdyn is said to have been its capital.  The origin of the name Perm is uncertain. Most common explanation derives the name "Perm" from "parma" ("forested highlands" in Komi language). While the city of Perm is a modern foundation named for Permia, the town of Cherdyn was reportedly itself known as the capital of "Great Perm" in the past. Cherdyn acted as a central market town, and it is sometimes suggested that perm was simply a term for "merchants" or "market" in a local language, but there have been other suggestions.

He described a form of government determined by a majority of men who were free citizens. There was little specialisation and only a loose power structure. Kings such as Gilgamesh of the first dynasty of Uruk did not yet hold an autocracy. Rather, they governed together with councils of elders and councils of younger men, who were likely free men bearing arms. Kings would consult the councils on all major decisions, including whether to go to war.

From Armani and/or Armânum  Early 20th century Armenologists have suggested that Old Persian 𐎠𐎼𐎷𐎡𐎴 a-r-mi-i-n(a) and the Greek Armenoi are continuations of an Assyrian toponym Armânum or Armanî. There are certain Bronze Age records identified with the toponym in both Mesopotamian and Egyptian sources. The earliest is from an inscription which mentions Armânum together with Ibla as territories conquered by Naram-Sin of Akkad in c. 2250 BC identified with an Akkadian colony in the Diarbekr region. Many historians, such as Wayne Horowitz, identify Armanî which was conquered by Naram-Sin of Akkad, with the Syrian city of Aleppo.  Armenia has also been claimed as a variant of Urmani (or Urmenu), attested epigraphically in an inscription of Menuas of Urartu.

In the Armenian language, the Proto-Indo-European intervocalic *-t- drops and yields /y/. Compare *ph₂tḗr → *hatir → *hayir → hayr ("father"). Other examples include *h₂eh₁ter- → *ātr- → *ayr → ayrem ("burn"), *bʰréh₂tēr → ełbayr ("brother").  The name Ḫāte was given by Urartians to all lands west of Euphrates, including the territory around Malatya (a region assumed to be occupied by speakers of Proto-Armenians). Diakonoff theorized that when the Urartians were assimilated among the Proto-Armenians, they took over their Indo-European language and called themselves by the same name of the "Hittites".  From Hayasa  Others suggest that the etymology of the hay- stem derives from the name of a realm in proximity to the Armenian Highlands called Ḫayaša. .

Upon his death, the Yellow Emperor was "said to have become" a xian.  Besides enlightened humans and fairy-like humanoid beings, xiān can also refer to supernatural animals, including foxes, fox spirits, and Chinese dragons. Xian dragons were thought to be the mounts of gods and goddesses or manifestations of the spirit of Taoists such as Laozi that existed in a mental realm sometimes called "the Heavens".  The mythological húlijīng  (lit. "fox spirit") "fox fairy; vixen; witch; enchantress" has an alternate name of húxiān  (lit. "fox immortal").  The etymology of xiān remains uncertain. The circa 200 CE Shiming, a Chinese dictionary that provided word-pun "etymologies",  defines xiān () as "to get old and not die," and explains it as someone who qiān ( "moves into") the mountains."

02/16/2024 03:06:16 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 3 unknown glyphs in sentence: In the cuisine of modern Rome quinto quarto (literally the "fifth quarter") is the offal of butchered animals. The name makes sense on more than one level: because offal amounts to about a fourth of the weight of the carcass; because the importance of offal in Roman cooking is at least as great as any of the outer quarters, fore and hind; and because in the past slaughterhouse workers were partly paid in kind with a share of the offal.  Until modern time the division of the cattle in Rome was made following this simple scheme: the first "quarto" was destined to be sold to the nobles, the second one was for the clergy, the third one for the Bourgeoisie and finally the fourth "quarto" was for the soldiers. The proletariat could afford only the entrails.  Offal cuisine is particularly rich in Rome in spring, when not only beef and pork but also suckling lamb and kid offal appears on trattorie menus. Typical dishes include: pajata (suckling kid, lamb or veal intestines) coratella (heart, lung and oesophagus of lamb or kid, sautéed with artichoke) testarelle (whole roasted lamb's or kid's head) ⰾⱁⰾ  See also   Italian cuisine  List of Italian dishes  Bibliography David Downie, Cooking the Roman Way.

Nathan Slavik of DJBooth praised the album's varied production for allowing Joe to deliver different topics through various regional flows, saying that, "While Joe has never produced a truly classic album, Elephant In The Room proves that his contributions to the game have been significant and long-lasting." AllMusic editor David Jeffries also praised Joe for changing his flow when switching from street tracks to radio singles, despite finding the drug talk monotonous and a lack of cohesion between him and the producers, concluding with, "Still, Joe warns the listener right at the beginning that he's more Eazy-E than Ice Cube -- and for three-fourths of the album, he's spot on." Latifah Muhammad of AllHipHop found a lack of cohesion between Joe and the producers on the record but felt that he managed to deliver tracks both commercially and artistically, saying that it "manages to show off Joes' clever mixture of street anthems and radio shiny tunes." .

The first part of the tale's plot is very similar to the European folk tale Cinderella.  Plot  Tấm's life before she marries the sovereign  The story is about two half-sisters; the eldest is named Tấm (broken rice) and the youngest is named Cám (rice bran). Tấm's mother dies early and her father remarries before dying soon after. Tấm lives with her stepmother, who is Cám's mother. The stepmother is very sadistic and makes Tấm do all the housework, whereas Cám does not have to do anything.  One day, the stepmother tells Tấm and Cám to go to the field to catch "tép" (caridina, a tropical genus of shrimp) and promises to give them a new red yếm (a Vietnamese traditional bodice) to whoever catches the most. Tấm soon fills up her basket, while Cám plays in the water and catches nothing. Realizing that her sister actually had a chance at receiving a red yếm and the day is almost done, Cám comes up with a plan to sabotage Tấm's work. Cám tells her older sister to wash her hair, saying that the stepmother will scold her if her hair is so muddy after catching all the caridinas, and Tấm obeys. While Tấm is washing her hair, Cám transfers all the shrimp from Tấm's basket to hers and goes home. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

Furthermore, it can be assumed that the pyroclastic flow of the eruption, whose temperature was estimated at  by Indonesian officials, killed much of the organic matter including plants and animals. As seen in the Mount St. Helens eruption, many insects would likely die due to the ash fall. This abrasion due to the ash causes quick desiccation. Although many insects may have survived from being in trees that were not torn down or deep in the ground, these insects may not live long after the event due to lack of resources.  Many larger animals may not have been able to escape the flow in time.  However, like at Mt. St. Helens, many of these animals could recover from pools of survivors and from migrations of other species.

02/16/2024 03:11:18 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 17 unknown glyphs in sentence: A Mobed, Mowbed, or Mobad (Middle Persian: 𐭬𐭢𐭥𐭯𐭲) is a Zoroastrian cleric of a particular rank. Unlike an herbad (ervad), a mobed is qualified to serve as celebrant priest at the Yasna ceremony and other higher liturgical ceremonies. A mobed is also qualified to train other priests.  Usage  In general (lay) use, the term is also used as an honorific to denote any Zoroastrian priest, of any rank. For instance, Hormizd I appointed Kartir moabadan-moabad, which is frequently translated as "priest of priests", but more precisely indicates "high priest of high priests".  The term "mobed" is a contraction of Middle Persian magu-pati, the first half of the expression apparently deriving from Avestan 𐬨𐬀𐬔𐬀 maga- or magu-, and with Avestan 𐬞𐬀𐬌𐬙𐬌 -paiti meaning "guardian" or "protector" (Persian root of  pâyidan) as in azarpäd. Through Old Persian 𐎶𐎦𐏁 magush and Ancient Greek μάγος magos, Old Iranian magu- is also identified as the origin of the Latin word magus, a "magian". Through the Greek adjective μαγικός magikos and Old French magique, 'mobed' is distantly related to the English language word "magic".  The word was borrowed into Georgian as Mogvi (მოგვი).

02/16/2024 03:11:19 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 15 unknown glyphs in sentence: Hērbad (also hīrbad, hērbed or ērvad) is a title given to Zoroastrian priests of minor orders.   In the present day, hērbad is the lowest rank in the Zoroastrian priesthood, and is granted following the basic navar ceremony that marks the beginning of theological training. Unlike a mobed or dastūr, a hērbad may not celebrate the yasna, the main service. He may however assist. A hērbad may also not officiate at a recitation of the Vendidad, which is reserved for priests of higher grade.   Amongst lay Zoroastrians, the three terms are used interchangeably. Unlike mobed but like dastūr, hērbad may be adopted as a professional title in a person's name.  History of term Middle Persian 𐭧𐭩𐭫𐭯𐭲 harpat (Pahlavi ʼyhlpt) derives from Avestan 𐬀𐬈𐬚𐬭𐬀𐬞𐬀𐬌𐬙𐬌 aethrapaiti, which the Avesta uses denote a priestly teacher whose students (aethrii) would be taught to recite the sacred texts. By the 2nd century CE, the term had come to refer to a clergyman who taught religious subjects, and the term appears to have commanded greater prestige than it does today. In the late 3rd century inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, the high-priest Kartir refers to himself as hērbad. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

The first seven named – who lived north of the Gobi Desert – were dominant, whereas the A-Busi and Gulunwugu(si) emerged later and were accepted on an equal footing with the others some time after 743. The A-Busi apparently originated as a sub-tribal group within the Sijie and the Gulunwugu(si) as a combination of two other tribes.  Latter Gōktürk Khagan Bilge considered the Toquz Oghuz "[his] own people".

A Khotanese Saka text about Turks in Ganzhou mentioned saikairä ttūrkä chārä (< OTrk. *sïqïr türk çor). The Sïqïr Türks were identified with the Sikāri in Sogdian documents as well as the Sijie, who were mentioned as Tujue Sijie 突厥思結 in Zizhi Tongjian. Among the Eastern Turkic tribes who dwelt south the Gobi desert, Tang Huiyao listed the Sijie (erroneously rendered as Enjie 恩結), who dwelt in the Lushan military governorate 盧山都督府, and Fuli, who dwelt in the same jimi province of Dailin as the Sijie's splinter tribe A-Busi.

Considered a commercial success for a world album, it reached number 4 on the United States Billboard Top World Music Albums chart and number 65 in the UK Albums Chart, where it charted for one week. The album was acclaimed by critics. Banning Eyre of AllMusic stated that “wherever you stand on Real World's arty aesthetics, you have to admire the Qawwali star's sense of adventure here.” Consumable Online said that “Night Song makes a great companion to either sudden revelation or a simple evening in the forest, under the stars,” commenting that "it is certainly one of the best collaborative albums of the year." The Guardian said it was “a quite sensational slow-burner of an album...Nusrat’s incredible vocal control and gift for wending his way round an evocative melody is bolstered by Brook’s sensitive ambient, gently beat-based arrangements. No-one deserves the extra exposure more than this peerless singer.” Time Out called it "the best world music album...ever!"Billboard called it “an album for the ages, solidifying Khan’s stature as one of the world’s pre-eminent singers.” Time Out said “the world’s best singer has a gag put in his mouth and delivers an ambient album that couldn’t be smoother if it was silk.” The Daily Telegraph said that "this collaboration with Michael Brook and his guitars provides the most natural complement to Nusrats harmonium-tabla drums formula, yet never overshadows the mystical power of his voice," whilst Folk Roots said that "this is a truly great record. Michael Brook is an unmistakably original producer who knows how to put a great vocal instrument into a stunning new context. This is a truly great record," and The Los Angeles View said that "this collaboration demonstrates a distinct stroke of genius, a most intoxicating spiritually uplifting cross-cultural expression." Keyboard Connections called it “a unique combination of intricate East-meets-West. Guitar, sampled drumbeats, and rhythmic vocals the like of which you’ve never heard before. Night Song presents an incomparable voice in a challenging setting.” Bhasker Gupta of All About Jazz retrospectively said, along with Mustt Mustt, “these are two very important albums — insistent yet melancholic, sacrilegious for purists, innovative for radicals — with Khan at his adventurous best.”.

It can also be assumed that Wilred is the same moneyer who struck coins for Offa of Mercia, possibly at Ipswich. Wilred's coins can be used to demonstrate that Offa's influence over the East Angles occurred at an earlier date than has previously been supposed, but are of little use in determining a secure chronology for Beonna's reign. Wilred's name is always depicted in runes. Nearly all his reverse dies have two crosses placed between the elements of his name (+ wil + red): most of the obverse dies show crosses and the king's name in a similar design, but also include an extra rune. This unique rune, similar to ᚹ, possibly meant walda ('ruler').  One type of coin for Beonna has no named moneyer and depicts an interlace motif on its reverse. A specimen of this type (now lost) was found at Dorestad, which was during Beonna's time an important trading centre: these coins resemble Frankish or Frisian deniers that were issued from the Maastricht area during this period. .

Later, some Uar returned to Zhetysu, and in cooperation with the Mukrins, a Xianbei tribe, occupied the Tianshan slopes in the 2nd century, retaining their independence for some time as the Western Xianbei Horde.   Zhetysu was also populated by the Azi (who lived between Suyab and Uzkent) and the Tuhsi. The Azi and Tuhsi are sometimes linked to Asii and Tukharas; Indo-European peoples who had conquered Bactria six centuries earlier, and formed the Kushan Empire. According to Persian historian Gardizi, Azi and Tuhsi were remnants of Türgesh, along with Khalaj. Karakhanid linguist Mahmud Kashgari described Tuhsi as a dynastic tribe of Turkic-speaking monoglots. This may suggest that Indo-European peoples underwent language replacement, in the form of "Turkification", had occurred.

Neptune   Several symbols were proposed for Neptune to accompany the suggested names for the planet. Claiming the right to name his discovery, Urbain Le Verrier originally proposed to name the planet for the Roman God Neptune and the symbol of a trident, while falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes. In October, he sought to name the planet Leverrier, after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, François Arago, who in turn proposed a new symbol for the planet, ⯉ (). However, this suggestion met with resistance outside France, and French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name Herschel for Uranus, after that planet's discoverer Sir William Herschel, and Leverrier for the new planet, though it was used by anglophone institutions. Professor James Pillans of the University of Edinburgh defended the name Janus for the new planet, and proposed a key for its symbol. Meanwhile, Struve presented the name Neptune on December 29, 1846, to the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences. In August 1847, the Bureau des Longitudes announced its decision to follow prevailing astronomical practice and adopt the choice of Neptune, with Arago refraining from participating in this decision..

02/16/2024 03:21:09 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 3 unknown glyphs in sentence: The sornā or sornāy (, also  surnā, surnāy and also Zurna) is an ancient Iranian woodwind instrument.  Etymology The word was most likely borrowed from an unknown Indo-European cognate of Luwian 𒍪𒌨𒉌 (zurni, “horn”), Sanskrit शृङ्ग (ṡṛṅga, “horn”), Latin cornū, and English horn, probably ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *ḱerh₂-. A folk etymology explains that the word sorna is a Pahlavi derivative of sūrnāy (literally "strong flute"), which is a compand of 'sūr-' (strong) and '-nāy' (flute). According to such folk etymology, it was called "strong flute" due to its double-reed-construction rather than usual nāy (), which was made of a single tube of cane, while another folk etymology believes that that the first part of word of sorna, is from sūr- again from Pahlavi and New-Persian, meaning the "banquet, meal and feast", thus the "banquet-flute".  "Sorna", being a cognate of "Horn", can simply mean horn. This is a result of the Centum-Satem isogloss, and later Grimm's Law. Even in Persian there is another wind instrument whose name appears to be a cognate of both "Sorna" and "Horn",  called "Karnā(y)" (); this may stem from a re-borrowing from another language.

It is important to mention that the term qutb has a special meaning in the Islamic tradition, referring to a spiritual symbol of particular time. It is also of importance that throughout their history Sufi orders in the Kingdom of Morocco developed and evolved around only two quṭbs—Moulay Abdessalam ben Mshish, a native of the Jbala who is viewed as the ‘western pole’, and Moulay Abdelqader Jilali, a native of Iraq who is regarded as the ‘eastern pole'.

Players formerly used silk strings, but since the late 20th century have generally used nylon.  Usage   It is used primarily in Northern Vietnam, and is one of the accompanying instruments used in ca trù.  In the late 20th century, a modernized version of the electric bass guitar in the shape of the đàn đáy was developed for use in the neo-traditional music composed and performed at the Hanoi Conservatory. Unlike the đàn đáy, this instrument has a solid wooden body and metal strings, and without raised frets.  Etymology In the Vietnamese language, đàn is a classifier used primarily to refer to string instruments, and đáy means "bottom." Thus, the instrument's name translates literally as "bottom string instrument." However, the instrument's body has no back. According to one online source, the instrument was originally called vô để cầm, literally "bottomless stringed instrument."

02/16/2024 03:26:19 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 2 unknown glyphs in sentence: The limit between rocky planets and planets with a thick gaseous envelope is calculated with theoretical models. Calculating the effect of the active XUV saturation phase of G-type stars over the loss of the primitive nebula-captured hydrogen envelopes in extrasolar planets, it's obtained that planets with a core mass of more than 1.5 Earth-mass (1.15 Earth-radius max.), most likely cannot get rid of their nebula captured hydrogen envelopes during their whole lifetime. Other calculations point out that the limit between envelope-free rocky super-Earths and sub-Neptunes is around 1.75 Earth-radii, as 2 Earth-radii would be the upper limit to be rocky (a planet with 2 Earth-radii and 5 Earth-masses with a mean Earth-like core composition would imply that 1/200 of its mass would be in a H/He envelope, with an atmospheric pressure near to ).  Whether or not the primitive nebula-captured H/He envelope of a super-Earth is entirely lost after formation also depends on the orbital distance. For example, formation and evolution calculations of the Kepler-11 planetary system show that the two innermost planets Kepler-11b and c, whose calculated mass is ≈2 M🜨 and between ≈5 and 6 M🜨 respectively (which are within measurement errors), are extremely vulnerable to envelope loss.  In particular, the complete removal of the primordial H/He envelope by energetic stellar photons appears almost inevitable in the case of Kepler-11b, regardless of its formation hypothesis..

It literally means "possessing/mastering aša" and has been interpreted as "possessing/mastering truth" or "possessing/mastering righteousness", but has further implications:   It is an epithet of Ahura Mazda (Yasht 1.12). The term may then be applied to anything within the domain of Ahura Mazda and/or Aša (i.e. all of Creation), and excludes only that which is  drəgvant "possessing lie" (YAv: drvant).  With respect to mortals and in an eschatological and sotereological context, ašavan is also a quality that can be acquired in life. Then, having acquired the qualities of an ašavan, one becomes an ašavan (through "blessed union with aša") after death. (See also: aša: in eschatology and sotereology). This soteriological meaning of ašavan is also evident in Xerxes' daiva inscription, an Old Persian text (XPh, early 5th century BCE). This next-world meaning of ašavan is preserved in Middle Iranian languages as Pahlavi ahlav.  Ašavan may be used to denote any follower of the "Good Religion." This is the most common use of ašavan, applicable to any who walk the "path of truth" (Yasna 68.12 and 68.13). In this context, Ašavan is frequently translated as "righteous person" or "blessed person." This general meaning of ašavan is preserved in Middle Iranian languages as Pahlavi ardav. .

Arabs were not considered as subjects to the Achaemenids, as other peoples were, and were exempt from taxation. Instead, they simply provided 1,000 talents of frankincense a year. They also helped the Achaemenids invade Egypt by providing water skins to the troops crossing the desert.  They were enrolled in the Achaemenid army and participated to the Second Persian invasion of Greece (479–480 BCE).

It was situated east of the Sulaiman Mountains up to the Indus River in the basin around Bannu in modern day's southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.  Geography The location of Sattagydia has been subject to debate. Its association with Gandara in the 7th tax district of the Herodotus list implies that it was close to Gandara. Olmstead believed that it stretched from "the lower slopes of the Hindu Kush". Based on these considerations, two locations have been proposed: the first being "the area of the confluence of the Ghorband and Panjshir rivers in Afghanistan", and the second, "the area of the middle Indus, around the modern city of Bannu". .

Chorasmia had become part of the Achaemenid Empire before 522 BCE, and it seems to have been ruled by the satrap of Parthia.   There exists an archaeological site in Kalaly-gyr, modern Kazakhstan, in a rectangular area 1,000 x 600 m surrounded by a defensive wall 15 m thick, and an Achaemenid-style palace at its center, all of which were unfinished, suggesting the Persians' departure from Chorasmia shortly after the beginning of the 4th century BC. By the time of the Persian king Darius III, it had already become an independent kingdom. Its king, Pharasmanes, concluded a peace treaty with Alexander the Great in the winter of 327/328 A.D/C.E.

The territory was conquered from the Kingdom of Kush. Herodotus mentioned an invasion of Kush by the Achaemenid ruler Cambyses (c. 530 BC). By some accounts Cambyses succeeded in occupying the area between the first and second Nile cataract,[49] however Herodotus mentions that "his expedition failed miserably in the desert."[46]: 65–66  Achaemenid inscriptions from both Egypt and Iran include Kush as part of the Achaemenid empire.[50] For example, the DNa inscription of Darius I (r. 522–486 BC) on his tomb at Naqsh-e Rustam mentions Kūšīyā (Old Persian cuneiform: 𐎤𐎢𐏁𐎡𐎹𐎠, pronounced Kūshīyā) among the territories being "ruled over" by the Achaemenid Empire.

The first mention of the Yauna is at the Behistun inscription.  History Achaemenid conquest (c. 546 – 479 BC)  In the mid-6th century BC, the Ionians were conquered by Cyrus the Great and according to Herodotus, they were placed in the same tax district (the first) as the Pamphylians, Lycians, Magnesians, Aeolians, Milyans, and Carians. It is unclear to what extent the Yauna were advantaged or disadvantaged by Persian rule, and what caused the Ionian Revolt which broke out in c. 499 BC and lasted until 494 BC.

Another possible origin involves King Cheng of Zhou's youngest son's acquisition of the name when he was given what would become the Shan state when the enfeoffment system was enacted during the Zhou dynasty. The Shan state existed for a few hundred years before it was annexed by a stronger neighbouring state. It was located in present-day Jiyuan, Henan province.

It bears the earliest known inscription that can be argued to be in Anglo-Frisian Futhorc (as opposed to Common Germanic Elder Futhark).  The image on the bracteate is an adaptation of an Urbs Roma coin type issued by Constantine the Great, conflating the helmeted head of the emperor and the image of Romulus and Remus suckled by the she-wolf on one face. With a diameter of 2.3 cm, it weighs 2.24 grams. It may have originated in northern Germany or southern Scandinavia and been brought to England with an early Anglo-Saxon settler.

He is mentioned as the first king in a list of royals in a Satavahana inscription at Nanaghat. In the Puranas, the name of the first Andhra (Satavahana) king is variously spelt as Shivmukha, Sishuka, Sindhuka, Chhismaka, Shipraka, Srimukha, etc. These are believed to be corrupted spellings of "Simuka", resulting from copying and re-copying of manuscripts.  Based on available evidence, Simuka cannot be dated with certainty. According to one theory, he lived in 3rd century BCE; but he is generally thought to have lived in the 1st century BCE.

02/16/2024 03:51:56 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 5 unknown glyphs in sentence: Abdi-Ashirta (Akkadian: 𒀵𒀀𒅆𒅕𒋫 Warad-Ašîrta [ARAD2-A-ši-ir-ta]; fl. 14th century BC) was the ruler of Amurru who was in conflict with King Rib-Hadda of Byblos.  While some contend that Amurru was a new kingdom in southern Syria subject to nominal Egyptian control, new research suggests that during Abdi-Ashirta's lifetime, Amurru was a "decentralized land" that consisted of several independent polities. Consequently, though Abdi-Ashirta had influence among these polities, he did not directly rule them. Rib-Hadda complained bitterly to Pharaoh Akhenaten — in the Amarna letters (EA) — of Abdi-Ashirta's attempts to alter the political landscape at the former's expense. Abdi-Ashirta's death is mentioned in EA 101 by Rib-Hadda in a letter to Akhenaten. Unfortunately for Rib-Hadda, Abdi-Ashirta was succeeded by his equally capable son Aziru, who would later capture, exile and likely kill Rib-Hadda. Aziru subsequently defected to the Hittites, which caused Egypt to lose control over her northern border province of Amurru which Aziru controlled.

Name  The khagan's underlying Turkic name, transcribed with Chinese characters 賀魯, became a debate among scholars. Gumilyov proposed Hallïğ, meaning "Elevated". Von Gabain proposed name Kullïğ (slave owner). Gömeç argued for Uluğ meaning "Great",. Meanwhile, Kapusuzoğlu proposed Kutluğ (Blessed) as his underlying Turkic name. Zuev (1960) linked the Khagan personal name Helu (< MC *ɣa-lou) with the tribal name Khallukh attested by Persian and Arab writers, and asserted that by the 7th century Helu's tribe was dynastic; later, however, Zuev (2002) proposed that Chinese Helu reflects Turkic *aru ~ arïğ "pure, light".  Early years  His parentage is uncertain. According to Gumilov his father was Böri Shad, however Chavannes attributes him to be a son of Irbis Seguy. He was awarded with the title shad by Dulu khagan in 633 and appointed to govern certain tribes including Chuye, Qarluq, Nushibi. In 646 he rose against Irbis Seguy only to be defeated by him.

She was considered a daughter of Bau and Ningirsu.  Name The reading of the first cuneiform sign in the theonym dḪÉ-gír(-nun-na) is not certain. Among the authors who employ the form Ḫegir(nunna) are Wilfred G. Lambert and Andrew R. George. Toshiko Kobayashi omits the breve below the first consonant, and renders the name as Hegir. The romanization Gangir has also been proposed, and has been adopted for example by Mark Cohen. Kobayashi refers to Ḫegirnunna as the full form of the name, but  notes that the difference between the variants seems to be chronological, with the shorter form being older.   It is assumed that gír in the short form and gír-nun in the long one both refer to a procession route located in Girsu, and that ḪÉ might represent an allograph of the word gemé, which makes it possible to translate the name from Sumerian as "the maid of the (lofty) way".

The name was also applied to a star associated with Nabu. Lisin's spouse was Ninsikila, whose gender also changed between periods. It was believed that they had eight children. The initial cult center of Lisin is uncertain, with locations such as Adab and Kesh being often proposed. She is attested in texts from various cities, including Umma, Lagash, Nippur and Meturan.

Name The name of Dumuzid's mother was usually written as dBE-du. The cuneiform sign BE has two possible readings, sír and dur7. Duttur is the commonly accepted reading of the name in modern scholarship, though the variant Durtur is also in use.

It talks about the Ashoka's (r.268 - 232 BC) victory over Kalinga (262 - 261 BC) and mentions his remorse for the half million killed or deported during his conquest, by "Dhamma". The edict asserts that in no land, except those of the Greeks, do not orders of Brahmans and Śramaṇa now exist to instruct on "Dhamma"; the forest tribes should repent or be killed; and he has conquered the lands, for 600 Yojana, to the borders of several named Greek rulers:   Amtiyoga or Amtiyaka (𑀅𑀁𑀢𑀺𑀬𑀓), identified with Antiochus II Theos (r.261 - 246 BC) of the Seleucid Empire  Tulamaya (𑀢𑀼𑀭𑀫𑀸𑀬), identified with Ptolemy III Euergetes of Egypt (r.246 - 222 BC)  Antekina (𑀅𑀁𑀢𑁂𑀓𑀺𑀦), identified with Antigonus Gonatus of Macedonia (r.277 - 239 BC)  Maka, identified with Magas of Cyrene (r.276 – 250 BC)  Alikyashudala, possibly identified with Alexander II of Epirus (r.272 - 255 BC) It also mentions the victory of Dhamma in south India among the Cholas and Pandyas, as far as Ceylon.

The subject of the Major Rock Edicts is the Dharma, which is essentially described as a corpus of moral and social values ("compassion, liberality, thruthfulness, purity, gentleness, goodness, few sins, many virtuous deeds") and neither the Buddha, nor the Samgha, nor Buddhism are ever mentioned. The only likely mention of Buddhism only appears with the word "Sramanas" ("ascetics"), who are always mentioned next to "Brahmanas", in what appears as a rather neutral enumeration of the major religious actors of the period. In the 12th Major Rock Edict, Ashoka also claims to be honouring all sects.  In Major Rock Edict No.8 though, Ashoka unambiguously describes his pilgrimage to Sambodhi ( Saṃ+bodhi, “Complete Enlightenment”), another name of Bodh Gaya, the location of the Buddha's awakening. Ashoka also repeatedly condemns ceremonies and sacrifices, an apparent attack on Brahmanism. In the Major Rock Edicts Ashoka also expresses his belief in karma and rebirth, affirming that good deeds with be rewarded in this life and the next, in Heaven (𑀲𑁆𑀯𑀕 svaga). .

02/16/2024 04:02:27 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 2 unknown glyphs in sentence: The difficulty that medieval scribes had to face while attempting to codify the language was the inadequacy of the Latin alphabet to some features of Old Polish phonology, such as vowel length and nasalization, or the palatalization of consonants. Thus, Old Polish did not have a unified spelling. Polish glosses in Latin texts use romanized spelling, which often failed to distinguish between distinct phonemes. Already then, however, certain spellings of proper names become unified.  The spelling in the major works of Old Polish, such as the Holy Cross Sermons or the Sankt Florian Psalter is better developed. Their scribes tried to resolve the aforementioned issues in various ways, which led to each manuscript having separate spelling rules. Digraphs were commonly employed to write sounds not present in Latin, the letter ⟨ꟁ⟩ with appearance varying between ⟨ꟁ⟩, ⟨ø⟩ and ⟨ɸ⟩ (see image on the right) was introduced to spell the nasal vowels, and the basic Latin letters were now used consistently for the same sounds. Nevertheless, many features were still only rarely marked, for example vowel length.  Parkoszowic . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.
02/16/2024 04:02:27 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 3 unknown glyphs in sentence: About 1440, , a professor of Jagiellonian University, was the first person to attempt a codification of Polish spelling. He wrote a tract on Polish orthographic rules (in Latin) and a short rhyme  (in Polish) as an example of their use. The rules that were proposed included the following:  introduction of new letters of different shape to write hard (unpalatalized) consonants, while soft (palatalized) consonant letters were left unchanged,  doubling of vowel letters to mark long sounds, for example: ⟨aa⟩ – /aː/ (but only if length decided the meaning of a word),  use of the letter ⟨ꟁ⟩ to write the short nasal vowel (⟨ꟁꟁ⟩ for the long nasal vowel),  use of the letter ⟨g⟩ to write /j/, reserving ⟨q⟩ for /ɡ/ instead,  use of digraphs and trigraphs to distinguish between the various coronal fricatives and affricate.  Parkoszowic's proposal was not adopted, as his conventions were judged to be impractical and cumbersome and bore little resemblance to the spellings commonly used. However, his tract is of great importance to the history of the Polish language, as the first scientific work about the Polish language. It provides especially useful insight to contemporary phonology.  Phonology  Over the centuries, Old Polish pronunciation underwent several changes.  Consonants .

The contents of the Kamloops Wawa were near-entirely written using Le Jeune's adaptation of the French Duployan shorthand writing system, called "chinuk pipa" in Chinook Jargon itself.  Most of the texts of the Kamloops Wawa were composed in the local variant of Chinook Jargon with some passages and articles in Nlaka'pamuxtsin, Secwepmectsin, St'at'imcets and other traditional languages.

It is the principal traditional area of which a certain indigenous corporate family group has customary use, occupancy, governance, stewardship and ownership rights. It is applied to designate areas such as countries and settlements such as towns and a trapline in the non-native sense, that is the area within which a certain person has the right to trap, but the common translation "trapline" is misleading both in that it is not restricted to the right to trap and it is independent of the provincial system of trapline registration. Indeed, one source of disparity between provincially registered traplines and keyoh, is that provincially registered traplines are held by a single individual who for many years had to be male, while keyoh are held corporately, with its hereditary chief also being strongly patrilineal.  The hereditary chief of a Keyoh is known as the keyoh-whudachun, Keyoh Holder or noble. The term keyoh is used in reference to Indigenous rights as on the web site of the Maiyoo Keyoh  Keyohs predate the Canadian Indian Act statutory creations of Indian Bands, such as Nak'azdli Band, and keyohs continue to persist to the present.

The member tribes of the Bakil Confederation are found primarily in the far north of the country; its leaders today are the Alshaif family  Ancient history  Hashid and Bakil were the sons of Jashim bin Jubran bin Nawf bin Tuba'a bin Zayd bin Amro bin Hamdan. Bani Hamdan was already a well known clan in the 1st century AD and it was mentioned in Sabaean inscriptions. Therefore, Hashid and Bakil (the brothers) must have lived in the BC era. In the Middle Sabaean period (the 1st to 4th centuries CE) the Bakil confederation consisted of three sha`bs - Raydah, Amran, and Shibam.  In the 3rd century most of Hamdan migrated to Syria. Hashid and Bakil switched their alliance to Himyar.  Conversion to Islam  In the year 622, prophet Muhammad sent Khalid ibn Al-Walid to Yemen to call them to Islam.

02/16/2024 04:13:44 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 19 unknown glyphs in sentence: Aeshma (Avestan: 𐬀𐬉𐬴𐬨𐬀 aēṣ̌ma; Old Avestan: 𐬀𐬉𐬱𐬆𐬨𐬀 aēšəma) is the Younger Avestan name of Zoroastrianism's demon of "wrath." As a hypostatic entity, Aeshma is variously interpreted as "wrath," "rage," and "fury." His standard epithet is "of the bloody mace."  Tri-syllabic aeshma is already attested in Gathic Avestan as aēšəma, though not yet—at that early stage—as an entity. The word has an Indo-Iranian root, descendant of the Proto-Indo-European root *eis, making it cognate with the Latin īra. In the Zoroastrian texts of the 9th–12th centuries, aeshma appears as Middle Persian eshm 𐭠𐭩𐭱𐭬 or 𐭧𐭩𐭱𐭬 kheshm, continuing in Pazend and New Persian as  khashm. Judaism's Asmodeus ( ʼšmdʼy) may derive from Avestan aeshma.daeva. The Georgian language word for devil—eshmaki—likewise derives from aeshma.  In scripture In the hierarchy of Zoroastrian demons (daevas) that mirrors a similar hierarchy of divinities, Aeshma is opposed to Asha Vahishta, the Amesha Spenta that is the hypostasis of "Truth." This opposition also reflects Aeshma's position as messenger of Angra Mainyu (Yasht 19.46), for in the hierarchy of divinities, Asha is the messenger of Spenta Mainyu, the instrument through which Ahura Mazda has realized ("created by His thought") creation. .

02/16/2024 04:13:53 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 17 unknown glyphs in sentence: The Apracharajas (Kharosthi: 𐨀𐨤𐨿𐨪𐨕𐨪𐨗 , , 𐨀𐨤𐨕𐨪𐨗 , ), also known as Avacarajas (Kharosthi: 𐨀𐨬𐨕𐨪𐨗 , ), were an Indo-Scythian ruling dynasty of present-day western Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan. The Apracharaja capital, known as Apracapura (also Avacapura), was located in the Bajaur district of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Apraca rule of Bajaur lasted from the 1st century BCE to the 1st century CE.  Origins Before the arrival of the Indo-Greeks and the Indo-Scythians, Apracan territory was the stronghold of the warlike Aspasioi tribe of Arrian, recorded in Vedic Sanskrit texts as Ashvakas. The Apracas are known in history for having offered a stubborn resistance to the Macedonian invader, Alexander the Great in 326 BCE.  The Indo-Scythians of the Apracharajas dynasty were successors of the Indo-Scythian king Azes. It seems that they established their dynasty from around 12 BCE. Their territory seems to have centered in Bajaur and extended to Swat, Gandhāra, Taxila, and parts of eastern Afghanistan.  Buddhism The Apracharajas embraced Buddhism: they are known for their numerous Buddhist dedications on reliquaries. On their coins Hellenic designs, derived from the coinage of the Indo-Greeks, continued to appear alongside Buddhist ones. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

02/16/2024 04:16:22 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 8 unknown glyphs in sentence: Aspavarma or Aspa (Kharosthi: 𐨀𐨭𐨿𐨤𐨬𐨪𐨿𐨨 , ) was an Indo-Scythian ruler of the clan of the Apraca, who ruled from around 15 to 45 CE. He ruled in the Bajaur area of modern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan and is considered one of the Apraca rulers. He is essentially known through his coins and a few inscription.  Inscriptions Asparvama was a son of Apraca king Indravarma, as known from an inscription discovered in Taxila, who himself is known to be the son of Vispavarma according to Indravarma's Silver Reliquary.  Indravarma's Silver Reliquary, which is known for sure to be before the Bajaur casket, hence before 5-6 CE, and is therefore usually dated to the end of the 1st century BCE, describes Aspavarma's grandfather Vispavarma as a general, and not yet a king at that time. This tends to confirm that his grandson, Aspavarma, probably ruled quite some time later, in the middle of the 1st century CE.  Aspavarma is also referenced in Gāndhārī texts, written in Kharoṣṭhī script, dating from the period.  Coinage The coinage shows the king on a horse, holding a whip in his right hand, in a style consistent with that of Azes II (who possibly is identical with Azes I). On the reverse, Athena makes a benediction gesture, and is flanked by a Buddhist triratna symbol. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.
02/16/2024 04:18:44 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 4 unknown glyphs in sentence: Mazaeus or Mazday (Aramaic: 𐡌𐡆𐡃𐡉 MZDY, Greek: Μαζαῖος Mazaios) (died 328 BC) was an Achaemenid Persian noble and satrap of Cilicia and later satrap of Babylon for the Achaemenid Empire, a satrapy which he retained under Alexander the Great.  Life Mazaeus was the penultimate Persian satrap (governor) of Cilicia. His successor in Cilicia was Arsames, who was ultimately expelled by Alexander the Great.  At the Battle of Gaugamela, Mazaeus commanded the right flank with the Syrian, Median, Mesopotamian, Parthian, Sacian, Tapurian, Hyrcanian, Sacesinian, Cappadocian, and Armenian cavalry.  As a reward for his recognition of Alexander as the legitimate successor of Darius, Mazaeus was rewarded by being able to retain the satrapy of Babylon, as a Hellenistic satrap. Alexander left a Macedonian, Apollodorus of Amphipolis, as the military commander of the garrison of Babylon, and another as tax-collector. Mazaeus continued minting coins under his name, and later without his name.  The daughter of the Persian king Darius III, Stateira II, was originally betrothed to him, but he died before they could be married. She was eventually married to Alexander.  Waldemar Heckel suggested that the Alexander Sarcophagus might have been dedicated to him.  Mazaeus was replaced as satrap of Babylon by Stamenes.  Coinage.

He was the father of Bhumaka, and the grandfather of Nahapana.  He is known through his coins, which are found in the northern Pakistan area of Chukhsa, and then later in the south, suggesting a southern migration at some point, possibly in search for trade.  His coins have been found in Afghanistan and as far as Arab states of the Persian Gulf. The coinage, reminiscent of the coinage of the Indo-Greeks, has on the obverse a winged Nike with Greek legend "CATRAPATOY CATRAΠOY AYBIPAKOY" ("Abhiraka, Satrap of the Satraps"), and the reverse shows a lion or a horse facing a wheel, with Brahmi or Kharoshthi legend around ''Khaharatasa Khatrapasa Abhirakasa jayatasa Abhirakasa" ("The Khsaharata Satrap Abhiraka, victory to Abhiraka").  "Abhiraka" may also mean "member of the tribe of the Abhiras", and a connection between "Abhiraka" and the tribe of the Abhiras has also been proposed.  Notes  References  R.C.

02/16/2024 04:19:50 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: Runestone U 104 (original location) is in red sandstone measuring  in height and  in width. It was first documented by Johannes Bureus in 1594. It was donated as one of a pair (the other is U 1160) to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford in 1687 upon the request of king James II of England to king Charles XI of Sweden asking for two runestones to add to the Oxford University collection. It is in the Urnes (Pr5) style. It was raised by Þorsteinn in memory of his father Sveinn and his brother Þórir, both of whom went to Greece, and lastly in memory of his mother. The stone is signed by the runemaster Öpir whose Old Norse is notable for its unorthodox use of the haglaz rune (ᚼ), as in hut for Old Norse út ("out"). The erratic use of the h-phoneme is a dialect trait that has survived and is still characteristic for the modern Swedish dialect of Roslagen, one of the regions where Öpir was active.

They were out to Greece. And after Ingiþóra, his mother. Œpir carved."  U 112  Runestone U 112 (location), a large boulder measuring  in circumference, is beside a wooded path named Kyrkstigen ("church path") in Ed. It has been known to scholars since Johannes Bureus' first runological expedition in 1594, and it dates to the mid-11th century.  The boulder bears runic inscriptions on two of its sides, referred to as U 112 A and B. The linguistic significance of the inscriptions lies in the use of the haglaz (ᚼ) rune to denote the velar approximant  (as in Ragnvaldr), something that would become common after the close of the Viking Age. The inscription also includes some dotted runes, and the ansuz () rune is used for the  phoneme.  The inscriptions are in the Urnes style (Pr4), and they were commissioned by a former captain of the Varangian Guard named Ragnvaldr in memory of his mother as well as in his own honour. Very few could boast of returning home with the honour of having been the captain of the Varangian Guard. Moreover, the name Ragnvaldr shows that he belonged to the higher echelons of Old Norse society, and that he may have been a relative of the ruling dynasty. .

02/16/2024 04:20:38 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 7 unknown glyphs in sentence: The Kayanians (Persian: دودمان کیانیان; also Kays, Kayanids, Kaianids, Kayani, or Kiani) are a legendary dynasty of Persian/Iranian tradition and folklore which supposedly ruled after the Pishdadians. Considered collectively, the Kayanian kings are the heroes of the Avesta, the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism, and of the Shahnameh, the national epic of Greater Iran.  As an epithet of kings and the reason the dynasty is so called, Middle 𐭪𐭣 and New Persian kay(an) originates from Avestan 𐬐𐬀𐬎𐬎𐬌 kavi (or kauui) "king" and also "poet-sacrificer" or "poet-priest". Kavi may have originally signified an insightful fashioner in Proto-Indo-Iranian, which later acquired a poetic aspect in Indic and warrior and royal connotation in Iranian.  The word is also etymologically related to the Avestan notion of kavaēm kharēno, the "divine royal glory" that the Kayanian kings were said to hold. The Kiani Crown is a physical manifestation of that belief.  In scripture The earliest known foreshadowing of the major legends of the Kayanian kings appears in the Yashts of the Avesta, where the dynasts offer sacrifices to the god Ahura Mazda in order to earn their support and to gain strength in the perpetual struggle against their enemies, the Anaryas (non-Aryans, sometimes identified as the Turanians). .

02/16/2024 04:21:27 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: Hamza ( ) () is a letter in the Arabic alphabet, representing the glottal stop . Hamza is not one of the 28 "full" letters and owes its existence to historical reform of standard writing system. It is derived from the Arabic letter ʿAyn ( ). In the Phoenician, Hebrew and Aramaic alphabets, from which the Arabic alphabet is descended, the glottal stop was expressed by alif (𐤀), continued by Alif (ا) in the Arabic alphabet. However, Alif was used to express both a glottal stop and also a long vowel . In order to indicate that a glottal stop is used, and not a mere vowel, it was added to Alif diacritically. In modern orthography,  hamza may also appear on the line, under certain circumstances as though it were a full letter, independent of an Alif.  Etymology  Hamza is derived from the verb  () meaning 'to prick, goad, drive' or 'to provide (a letter or word) with hamzah'.  Hamzat al-waṣl (ٱ)  .

Amerdad is the Amesha Spenta of long life on earth and perpetuality in the hereafter.  The word  is grammatically feminine and the divinity Amerdad is a female entity. Etymologically, Avestan  derives from an Indo-Iranian root and is linguistically related to Vedic Sanskrit amṛtatva. In Sassanid Era Zoroastrian tradition, Amerdad appears as Middle Persian 𐭠𐭬𐭥𐭫𐭣𐭠𐭣 Amurdad, continuing in New Persian as مرداد Mordad or Amordad. It is followed by Shehrevar.  In scripture  In the Gathas Like the other Amesha Spentas also, Ameretat is already attested in the Gathas, the oldest texts of the Zoroastrianism and considered to have been composed by Zoroaster himself. And like most other principles, Ameretat is not unambiguously an entity in those hymns. Unlike four of the other Amesha Spentas, Ameretat does not have a standing epithet that in later Avesta texts becomes an element of her proper name. .

02/16/2024 04:23:59 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: The next date is 555 BC, which comes from the Zuo zhuan describing a Jin invasion of Qi that year which involved a Qi fortification, claimed by the Shui Jing Zhu to be part of the Great Wall of Qi. The Zuo zhuan itself, however, never used the term "great wall" (長城 changcheng) or referred to other fortifications along Qi's southern border, throwing doubts into this identification.  The date 441 BC comes from the Xinian () collection of the Tsinghua bamboo strips, which were discovered from a Chu tomb in Hebei or Hunan and acquired by the Tsinghua University in 2008. Xinian was determined to be composed in the state of Chu no later than 370 BC, which puts it in good authority for the events it describes in its last four sections covering the period from 450 to 395 BC. Specifically, Xinian writes that Qi built the Great Wall "for the first time" after Zhao Huanzi () of Jin allied with the state of Yue to invade Qi. This date accords well with other records of battles happening along the wall in 404 BC, 365 BC, and 350 BC from the Bamboo Annals'' and inscriptions on the Piaoqiang bronze bells (𠫑羌鐘; discovered in Luoyang in 1928–1931).

02/16/2024 04:24:21 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 13 unknown glyphs in sentence: In Zoroastrianism, Spənta Ārmaiti (Avestan 𐬯𐬞𐬆𐬧𐬙𐬀 𐬁𐬭𐬨𐬀𐬌𐬙𐬌 for "Bounteous Harmony" or "Holy Devotion") is one of the Amesha Spentas, the seven divine manifestations of Wisdom and Ahura Mazda. While older sources present the Amesha Spentas more as abstract entities, in later sources Spenta Armaiti is personified as a female divinity with connotations of harmony and devotion.  Name Spenta Armaiti is known in later Iranian languages as Spandarmad (in Middle Persian) and Isfandārmaḏ (in Modern Persian).  Sometimes Armaiti is paired with other Zoroastrian deity, Zam ('earth'), another being associated with the Earth, thus forming a compound Zam-Armaiti or Zam-Armatay.  Cultic role In Zoroastrian religion, Spenta Armaiti is seen as the wife or companion of major deity Ahura Mazda, who, in some accounts, is described as her creator or father.  She is associated with earth and sacred literature describes her role as a Mother Nature character. Thus, she is linked to fertility and to farmers.  She is also associated with the dead.  Religious legacy In the Zoroastrian calendar, she is associated with the twelfth month ( ) and the fifth day of the month. The fifth day of the twelfth month is hence her holy day, Sepandārmazgān. Sepandārmazgān is an ancient festival to celebrate eternal love. Iranian lovers give each other gifts on this day.  Parallels. Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

It is found in the Napo and Pastaza River drainages in eastern Ecuador and in the Loreto Region, northern Peru. The specific name deridens is derived from Latin deridere, meaning "make fun of someone". This alludes to the males calling from the treetops that sound "as if they are laughing at the collectors' vain attempts to reach them". Common name funny slender-legged treefrog has been coined for this species.  Description Adult males measure  and adult females  in snout–vent length. The snout is rounded in profile and truncate in dorsal view. The tympanum is conspicuous but partly cover by the supratympanic fold. The fingers and the toes are partially webbed. The dorsum is dark tan, with variable markings (irregular dark tan blotches, suffusions of dark tan, irregular light brown spots or flecks, or light brown backward-pointing  triangle). The limbs have dark crossbars. The lower surfaces are creamy white.  Habitat and conservation Osteocephalus deridens inhabits Napo moist forests at elevations of  above sea level. It occurs in the canopy of primary forest. Males call usually higher than  above the ground, and the tadpoles develop in bromeliads, often higher than  above the ground. .

02/16/2024 04:28:55 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: Choerophryne gunnari is a species of frog in the family Microhylidae. It is endemic to Papua New Guinea and is known from the area of its type locality in the Central Province, and from the western slopes of Mount Obree, also in the Central Province.  Etymology This species was originally described in the genus Albericus, named for Alberich, the dwarf in Scandinavian mythology and Richard Wagner's opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen. Menzies named the species he described after Alberich's companions in the mythodology. The specific name gunnari is derived from Gunnar.  Description Ten individuals in the type series measure  in snout–urostyle length. The largest male was  and a female was  (reason for the discrepancy is unexplained). Six of the types were examined later and found to be males, measuring  in snout–vent length. The dorsal surface has a large, dark hour-glass mark on a greyish background. The ventral ground colour is whitish, but the throat is dark in both males and females. The belly has a large, dark, intense blue blotch, and hind limbs are marked with blue blotches alternating between lighter and darker shades. This blue pigmentation is unique among all former Albericus species known at the time.  The male advertisement call is said to lack "musical quality". It is a series of "clicks" emitted at a mean rate of 240 min1.  Habitat and conservation. Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.
02/16/2024 04:29:27 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 5 unknown glyphs in sentence: The origin of the name Όλυμπος (Olympos) is unknown. One theory suggests that it is compounded of ou lyma (οὐ λύμα) and pous (πούς), meaning "pure foot", conforming to Hesiod's description of the earth as a sort of footstool for heaven up from which rise the "Blessed Gods". According to Robert S.P. Beekes the word is of pre-Greek origin and he speculates that it originally meant "mountain". The word is also probably cognate with the Mycenean Greek word 𐀄𐀬𐀠𐀊𐀍 (u-ru-pi-ja-jo) which is, most likely, a term used to describe people, or possibly an ethnic group. In Homeric Greek (Odyssey 6.42), the variant Οὔλυμπος Oulumpos occurs, conceived of as the seat of the gods (and not identified with any specific peak). Homer (Iliad 5.754, Odyssey 20.103) also appears to be using οὔλυμπος as a common noun, as a synonym of οὐρανός ouranos "sky". Mount Olympus was historically also known as Mount Belus, after Iliad 1.591, where the seat of the gods is referred to as βηλὸς θεσπέσiος "heavenly threshold".  In Ancient Greek religion and mythology, "Olympus" was the name of the home of the Twelve Olympian gods.. Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

02/16/2024 04:30:20 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 10 unknown glyphs in sentence: House of Suren or Surenas (Parthian: 𐭎𐭅𐭓𐭉𐭍 Surēn, Middle Persian: 𐭮𐭥𐭫𐭩𐭭)  is one of two Parthian noble families explicitly mentioned by name in sources dateable to the Arsacid period.  History  The head of Suren family had the privilege to crown the first Parthian king in the 3rd century BC, which founded a tradition that was continued by his descendants. Following the 3rd century AD defeat of the Arsacids and the subsequent rise of the Sassanids, the Surenas then switched sides and began to serve the Persians, at whose court they were identified as one of the so-called "Parthian clans." The last attested scion of the family was a military commander active in northern China during the 9th century.  It is probable that the Surenas were landowners in Sakastan, that is, in the region between Arachosia and Drangiana in present-day southeast Iran and Southern Afghanistan. The Surenas appear to have governed Sistan (which derives its name from 'Sakastan' and was once a much larger region than the present day province) as their personal fiefdom. .

Not in an attempt to immediately rectify or justify myself, just to express it. I had to be damaged, to have faults, to show the darkness.

He is quoted as saying, "Although it's a love album, the theme is really more about my battle not to succumb to it. I guess I equated love with losing power, losing my goals and aspirations. I was trying to find the balance between honoring someone else and myself, while finding where the edges meet."

02/16/2024 04:35:56 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 4 unknown glyphs in sentence: The terminological problem dates from the Seleucid Empire (323–150 BC), which applied the term Syria, the Greek and Indo-Anatolian form of the name Assyria, which had existed even during the Assyrian Empire, not only to the homeland of the Assyrians but also to lands to the west in the Levant, previously known as Aramea, Eber Nari and Phoenicia (modern Syria, Lebanon and northern Israel) that later became part of the empire. This caused not only the original Assyrians, but also the ethnically and geographically distinct Arameans and Phoenicians of the Levant to be collectively called Syrians and Syriacs in the Greco-Roman world.  The 1997 discovery of the Çineköy inscription appears to prove conclusively that the term Syria was derived from the Assyrian term 𒀸𒋗𒁺 𐎹 Aššūrāyu., and referred to Assyria and Assyrian. The Çineköy inscription is a Hieroglyphic Luwian-Phoenician bilingual, uncovered from Çineköy, Adana Province, Turkey (ancient Cilicia), dating to the 8th century BCE. Originally published by Tekoglu and Lemaire (2000), it was more recently analyzed by historian Robert Rollinger, who lend a strong support to the age-old debate of the name "Syria" being derived from "Assyria" (see Name of Syria).

Black has improved in every aspect, and establishes herself as a truly credible R&B Canadian diva who deserves heaps of praise and success; Canada, you've found your Mary J." Ryan B. Patrick of Exclaim! also gave praise to the production but said that listeners might be put off by it playing safe and yearn for Black's trademark genre-mixing sound, concluding that, "In the grand scheme of things however, its remarkable that a Canadian R&B artist even gets to record a sophomore disc, much less one as ambitious as this. Revival rocks rightly, plays it safe and essentially ensures Black a lengthy and award-winning Canadian career." Jason Richards, writing for NOW, was critical of the album's single "Seven Day Fool" and felt that it carried over on the production sounding mainstream and radio-friendly, concluding that "[T]he canned production is undeservedly insipid and needlessly limits Black's potent and versatile energy.

The formulas of the inscription were immediately recognised as literary in nature, and the assured cutting of the archaic letters suggested to Charles Torrey a form of writing already in common use. A 10th-century BC date for the inscription has become widely accepted.  Halfway down the burial shaft another short inscription was found incised at the southern wall, the Byblos Necropolis graffito. The three-line graffito reads:   (1) ld‘t 𐤟 (2) hn yp?d lk 𐤟 (3) tḥt zn  It is usually interpreted as a warning not to proceed further:   (1) Know: (2) here is disaster(?) for you (3) below this.  Recently it has been proposed that it is part of some initiation ritual which remains unknown in detail:  Concerning knowledge: here and now be humble (you yourself!) ‹in› this basement!"  King Ahiram Ahiram himself is not titled a king, neither of Byblos nor of any other city state. It is said that he was succeeded by his son Ithobaal I who is the first to be explicitly entitled King of Byblos, which is due to an old misreading of a text lacuna. According to a new reconstruction of the lacuna the name of Ahiram's son is to be read [Pil]sibaal, and the reading Ithobaal should be disregarded.

He is best known for questioning King Darius in regard to the rebuilding of a temple for the Lord, God of Israel.  He was generally friendly to the Jews. The rebuilding was being led by Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, and had been issued by King Cyrus I. Tattenai wrote a letter to King Darius to ask if these statements were true, and then King Darius wrote a letter confirming that the statements were true.  In the letter, Darius asked that the people do everything they can to support this rebuilding financially, and that they do nothing to impede it lest they suffer harsh punishment.  Babylonian Cuneiform inscriptions  A number of cuneiform tablets bearing the name Tattenai have survived as part of what may have been a family archive. The tablet that links one member of this family to the Bible character is a promissory note dated to the 20th year of Darius I, 502 BC. It identifies a witness to the transaction as a servant of “Tattannu, governor of Across-the-River”. The clay tablet can be dated to June 5, 502 B.C.  exactly.

02/16/2024 04:53:26 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 2 unknown glyphs in sentence:  Critical reception Still da Baddest garnered generally positive reviews from critics, most of whom favored Trina's signature raunchy rap styling over a softer-side. Awarding the album three-and-a-half stars, David Jeffries of AllMusic praised the album for capturing the raw edge found on the rappers debut album with a modern twist, but had mixed emotions on the album's ability to duplicate the success found in "Here We Go" (2005). Jeffries continued his review by noting "I Got a Thing for You" and "Wish I Never Met You" as the album's main flaws, referencing them as "manufactured 'Here We Go' clones" dragging down what would otherwise be an entirely successful full-length. Jeffries ends his review by stating "It's the abundance of these brassy, 'love me or hate me' moments that make Still Da Baddest a step in the right direction and one of her better efforts, even with the woefully uninspired ballads." Praising Trina's appealing curves, frank attitude and seductive songs, Jason Seifer of Walmart praised Trina's raunchy style stating "Any concerns Trina had about being reduced in rank or status are quickly squashed within the span of a dozen tracks, leaving Katrina Taylor the freedom to get a little more personal with her audience." Seifer went on to compliment Trina's softer side on the Keyshia Cole-assisted "I Got A Thang For You," later showing great appreciation on the album's tracks that featured additional rappers and vocalists. Praising Trina as one of the few female rappers around at the time, Alex Thornton of HipHopDX noted that although Still da Baddest isn't a huge leap for Trina in terms of subject matter, more effort has been obviously put into this album than any of her past releases. Thornton went on to negatively state that the album is ultimately forgettable since much of her work borrows from recent Pop and Hip Hop successes by other artists, even though it was never intended to be an artsy, avant-garde offering for hipsters so the formulaic approach isn't as much of a problem as it might seem. Aisha Johnson of AllHipHop noted that the album lacks any true substance and fails to go beyond her sexually aggressive commentary. Praising Trinas fiery southern flow alongside guest appearances from Missy, Keyshia Cole, and Rick Ross to help bring forth some creative synergy, Johnson felt the LP doesn't compare to the rappers debut Da Baddest B***h. Awarding Trina with the title of "Queen Victoria of Rap," Evelyn McDonnell of VIBE praised the album for proving Trina to not be a "one trick pony," favoring standout tracks like "Clear It Out," "Single Again, "Look Back At Me," and "Wish I Never Met You.".

The text was written in 1820 by Hans Ferdinand Maßmann. It was one of the unofficial national anthems of West Germany from 1949 to 1952, when the "Deutschlandlied" was officially reinstated. Its tune is now used in the Micronesian national anthem.  History  The national anthem of the Federated States of Micronesia, "Patriots of Micronesia", uses the same tune, as does the Estonian song "Mu Isamaa armas" ("My beloved native land" by Martin Körber) which used to be Estonia's official flag song until 2009 when it was replaced by Gustav Ernesaks's "Mu Isamaa on minu arm" ("My homeland is my love"). The Latvian song "Šie kauli, šī miesa" also has the same tune. The melody is quoted by Johannes Brahms in his Academic Festival Overture. The Deutschlandfunk used the motif to the words "dir Land voll Lieb und Leben" as its interval signal.  The second stanza includes the words "land of the free", similar to the well-known words of "The Star-Spangled Banner", written eight years earlier.  Lyrics 1.

Tale of Aqhat The text in Corpus Tablettes Alphabétiques [CTA] 17–19 is often referred to as the Tale of Aqhat. Danel was depicted as "judging the cause of the widow, adjudicating the case of the fatherless" in the city gate. He passed through trials: his son Aqhat was destroyed but apparently in the missing conclusion was revived or replaced by Danel's patron god, Rpʼu, who sits and judges with Hadad and Astarte and was likely considered to be the equivalent of El.  The text was published and translated in 1936 by Charles Virolleaud and has been extensively analysed since then.  Danel and the Book of Ezekiel  Three verses in the Book of Ezekiel (, , and ) refer to DNʾL which, according to the Masoretic Text, should be read as "Daniel". This notwithstanding, parallels and contrasts with Danel (without i) of the Book of Ezekiel, placed between Noah and Job and invoked as the very example of righteous judgement, first pointed out by René Dussaud in 1931, have led readers commonly to accept or occasionally to reject a degree of identification with Ugaritic Danel of the "Aqhat text", amounting virtually to the same figure. .

Tolkien wondered why there was a word with this meaning, and conjectured that it had once had a different meaning, which he explored in detail in his essay "Sigelwara Land", published in two parts in 1932 and 1934. He stated that Sigel meant "both sun and jewel", the former as it was the name of the sun rune *sowilō (ᛋ), the latter from Latin sigillum, a seal. He decided that the second element was *hearwa, possibly related to Old English heorð, "hearth", and ultimately to Latin carbo, "soot". He suggested this implied a class of demons "with red-hot eyes that emitted sparks and faces black as soot". Shippey states that this "helped to naturalise the Balrog" (a demon of fire) and contributed to the sun-jewel Silmarils. The Aethiopians suggested to Tolkien the Haradrim, a dark southern race of men.  Nodens  . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

Apaliunas is considered to be the Hittite reflex of *Apeljōn, an early form of the name Apollo, which may also be surmised from comparison of Cypriot  (Apeílōn) with Doric  (Apéllōn).  Apaliunas is among the gods who guarantee a treaty drawn up about 1280 BCE between Alaksandu of Wilusa, interpreted as "Alexander of Ilios" and the great Hittite king, Muwatalli II. He is one of the three deities named on the side of the city. In Homer, Apollo is the builder of the walls of Ilium, a god on the Trojan side.

Tightly organized bundles of periplasmic flagella were observed in the periplasm, a characteristic of spirochetes. The presence of the periplasmic flagella is widely regarded as being responsible for the microorganism's ability to rotate and flex, in addition to its translational movement.

Using the area's thriving foreign trade, Shi Xie provided large amounts of tribute and eventually seated his three brothers Shi Yi (), Shi Hui (士䵋) and Shi Wu () as grand administrators over the neighbouring commanderies of Hepu, Jiuzhen, and Nanhai. He received the noble title  and fostered Buddhism in his territories, for which he is still worshipped under the name "King Si" (). After Shi Xie's death in 226, Sun Quan divided Jiao Province, creating a new Guang Province from Jiao Province's northern commanderies. Shi Xie's third son, Shi Hui (), attempted to resist this move by seizing control of Jiaozhi Commandery and opposing Dai Liang (), whom Sun Quan had appointed as the governor of Jiao Province. Huan Lin (), one of Shi Hui's subordinates, spoke in favour of surrendering to the legitimate administrator but ended up being killed by Shi Hui; Huan Lin's nephew, Huan Fa (), then led his men to besiege Jiaozhi Commandery for months. Shi Hui's cousin, Shi Kuang (), managed to convince Shi Hui to surrender when Sun Quan's forces, led by the general Lü Dai, showed up at Jiaozhi Commandery. Lü Dai pretended to accept Shi Hui's surrender, then later had him and his brothers executed and the rest of the Shi family reduced to commoner status. In 248, Lady Triệu and others rebelled, but most were bought off by Lu Yin () and the revolt collapsed.. Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

It is a festive occasion, at which members of an extended family gather together. Female family members traditionally spend the entire day cooking an elaborate banquet in honor of the deceased individual, which will then be enjoyed by all the family members. In addition, sticks of incense are burned in honor and commemoration of the deceased person. It is not unusual for a family to celebrate several  per year, so the ceremony serves as a time for families to reunite, much like the Vietnamese new year, Tết.  The rituals are the responsibility of whoever inherits the ancestral estates, typically the deceased's most senior patrilineal descendant.  Although a  is usually a private ceremony attended only by family members (and occasionally also close friends), some are commemorated by large segments of the population.  The commemoration of the Hùng Kings - who were instrumental in founding the first Vietnamese kingdom in Vietnam's remote past, and of the Trưng Sisters are widely participated.  In March 2007 Giỗ tổ Hùng Vương became a public holiday in Vietnam.

02/16/2024 05:18:50 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: TBX3 is overexpressed in a wide range of carcinomas (breast, pancreatic, melanoma, liver, lung, gastric, ovarian, bladder and head and neck cancers) and sarcomas (chondrosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, liposarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and synovial sarcoma) and there is compelling evidence that it contributes to several hallmarks of cancer. Indeed, TBX3 can bypass cellular senescence, apoptosis and anoikis as well as promote uncontrolled cell proliferation, tumor formation, angiogenesis and metastasis. Furthermore, TBX3 contributes to the expansion of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and is a key player in regulating pluripotency-related genes in these cells. CSCs contribute to tumor relapse and drug resistance and thus this may be another mechanism by which TBX3 contributes to cancer formation and tumor aggressiveness. The mechanisms by which TBX3 contributes to oncogenic processes involve, in part, its ability to inhibit the tumor suppressor pathways p14ARF/p53/p21WAF1/CIP1, p16INK4a/pRb, p57KIP2, PTEN, E-cadherin and activating the angiogenesis-associated genes FGF2 and VEGF-A and the EMT gene SNAI. Some of the oncogenic signaling molecules identified that upregulate TBX3 include TGF-β, BRAF-MAPK, c-Myc, AKT, and PLCᗴ/PKC. The function of TBX3 is also regulated by phosphorylation by the p38-MAPK, AKT3 and cyclin A/CDK2 and by protein co-factors, which include PRC2, Histone Deacetylases 1, 2, 3 and 5 and CAPERα..

02/16/2024 05:30:12 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: A wired logic connection is a logic gate that implements boolean algebra (logic) using only passive components such as diodes and resistors. A wired logic connection can create an AND or an OR gate. Limitations include the inability to create a NOT gate, the lack of amplification to provide level restoration, and its constant ohmic heating for most logic (particularly more than CMOS) which indirectly limits density of components and speed.  Wired logic works by exploiting the high impedance of open collector outputs (and its variants: open emitter, open drain, or open source) by just adding a pull-up or pull-down resistor to a voltage source, or can be applied to push-pull outputs by using diode logic (with the disadvantage of incurring a diode drop voltage loss).  Active-high wired AND connection   See also:   The wired AND connection is a form of AND gate. When using open collector or similar outputs (which can be identified by the ⎐ symbol in schematics), wired AND only requires a pull up resistor on the shared output wire. In this example, 5V is considered HIGH (true), and 0V is LOW (false). This gate can be easily extended with more inputs.  When all inputs are HIGH, they all present high impedance, and the pull-up resistor pulls output voltage HIGH, but if any input is LOW, they pull the output LOW: .

In Sumerian mythology, Dumuzid's sister was Geshtinanna, the goddess of agriculture, fertility, and dream interpretation. In the Sumerian King List, Dumuzid is listed as an antediluvian king of the city of Bad-tibira and also an early king of the city of Uruk.  In Inanna's Descent into the Underworld, Inanna perceives that Dumuzid has failed to properly mourn her death and, when she returns from the Underworld, allows the galla demons to drag him down to the Underworld as her replacement. Inanna later regrets this decision and decrees that Dumuzid will spend half the year in the Underworld, but the other half of the year with her, while his sister Geshtinanna stays in the Underworld in his place, thus resulting in the cycle of the seasons.

Takamasa's career demonstrated the transition of the lives of the samurai from service to their lords to civil or government service in modern Japan. This development was also indicative of the relationships between the samurai and their previous lords. In the case of Takamasa, his former liege promoted his employment – as was done for other former samurai (shizoku jusan) of the Kanazawa – by getting his appointment as Nomi County Chief approved. He was later appointed as the governor of Ishikawa Prefecture.  Takamasa was the father of Captain Tomojiro Chisaka, the Commander of the Yakumo, and Major Yojiro Chisaka, who served in the Imperial Army.

It is noted for the philosophical inscription by the Epicurean, Diogenes of Oenoanda.   The ruins of the city lie on a high isolated site west of the modern village İncealiler in the Fethiye district of Muğla Province, Turkey, which partly overlies the ancient site.  The place name suggests that it was known for viticulture.  History  The early history of the settlement is obscure, in spite of an exploratory survey carried out, with permission of the Turkish authorities, by the British Institute at Ankara (BIAA) in 1974–76.   The city was known as Wiyanawanda by the Hittites. It means "rich in vines/wine" or semantically "land of the wine". During the Bronze Age it was a part of the Lukka lands which corresponds to Lycia from classical antiquity.  It seems that Oenoanda became a colony of Termessos about 200-190 BC and was also called Termessos Minor (or Termessos i pros Oinoanda).  Oenoanda was the most southerly of the Kibyran Tetrapolis, formed in the 2nd c. BC (Hellenistic Period), with Bubon, Balbura, and Kibyra which was dissolved by L. Licinius Murena in 84 BC, whereupon Oenoanda became part of the Lycian League, as its inscriptions abundantly demonstrate. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.
02/16/2024 05:43:40 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 2 unknown glyphs in sentence: Hirsh's first book, At War with Ourselves: Why America Is Squandering Its Chance to Build a Better World, was described by Bill Keller in The New York Times as "well-informed, historically literate, nonideological common sense. That may sound like faint praise, but in an America that sometimes seems poised between reckless adventure and helpless inertia, centrist common sense is something to be treasured." In his second book, Capital Offense: How Washington's Wise Men Handed America's Future over to Wall Street'', Hirsh argues that in the 2008 financial crisis, "otherwise intelligent and capable men like Greenspan, Rubin and Summers  and later Hank Paulson and Tim Geithner  permitted themselves to believe, in the face of a rising tide of contrary evidence, that markets are for the most part efficient and work well on their own." Michiko Kakutani of The New York Times called the book "provocative" and noted that while much of its content had previously been covered in books by other authors (namely Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm together, David Wessel, Daniel Gross and Joseph E. Stiglitz), Hirsh still "does a highly informed, if decidedly opinionated, job of situating these developments within a historical context, and the book makes for useful and succinct reading".

02/16/2024 05:48:14 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: An X mark (also known as an ex mark or a cross mark or simply an X or ex or a cross) is used to indicate the concept of negation (for example "no, this has not been verified", "no, that is not the correct answer" or "no, I do not agree") as well as an indicator (for example, in election ballot papers or in maps as an x-marks-the-spot). Its opposite is often considered to be the O mark used in Japan and Korea or the check mark used in the West. In Japanese, the X mark (❌) is called "batsu" (ばつ) and can be expressed by someone by crossing their arms.  It is also used as a replacement for a signature for a person who is blind or illiterate and thus cannot write their name.  Typically, the writing of an X used for this purpose must be witnessed to be valid.  Contrary to the negation or negative perception delegated to the letter X , there is a significant resilience in the usage displayed by the letter's placement. This unique letter is also recognized as the symbol of multiplicity, the Roman numerical symbol for 10, and also the mark of a forgotten treasure. The letter X represents perseverance and preservation. As a verb, to X (or ex) off/out or to cross off/out means to add such a mark. It is quite common, especially on printed forms and document, for there to be squares in which to place x marks, or interchangeably checks. .

02/16/2024 05:49:11 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: Ṭawīl (, literally 'long'), or al-Ṭawīl (), is a meter used in classical Arabic poetry.  It comprises distichs (bayt) of two 'lines'—in Arabic usually written side by side, with a space dividing them, the first being called the sadr (صدر, literally "chest") and the other the ʿajuz (عجز, literally "belly"). Its basic form is as follows (the symbol – representing a long syllable, ⏑ representing a short syllable, and x representing a syllable that can be short or long):   | ᴗ – x | ᴗ – – – | ᴗ – x | ᴗ – ᴗ – |     (2×)  This form can be exemplified through the traditional mnemonic  ().  The final syllable of every distich rhymes throughout the whole poem; a long poem might comprise a hundred distichs. In Classical verse, each distich is a complete syntactic unit.  Variations  The Encyclopaedia of Islam records three sub-types of ṭawīl hemistich, of which the second is the most common:   | ᴗ – x | ᴗ – – – | ᴗ – x | ᴗ – ᴗ – | * | ᴗ – x | ᴗ – – – | ᴗ – x | ᴗ – – – |  | ᴗ – x | ᴗ – – – | ᴗ – x | ᴗ – ᴗ – | * | ᴗ – x | ᴗ – – – | ᴗ – x | ᴗ – ᴗ – |  | ᴗ – x | ᴗ – – – | ᴗ – x | ᴗ – ᴗ – | * | ᴗ – x | ᴗ – – – | ᴗ – x | ᴗ – – |  In the rare cases where a poem requires rhyme at the end of each hemistich, the last foot of the first hemistich has the same pattern as the last foot of the second, to enable the rhyme.  In ancient poetry, the first unstressed syllable of the line is sometimes omitted, and the second foot of each hemistich can be | ᴗ – ᴗ – | instead of | ᴗ – – – |.  Occurrence .

Soon, however, his nephew Bilge Khagan settled down the situation.  Wang, believing that the Göktürks who surrendered would try to flee back to the Göktürk state, suggested that they be forcibly moved into the heart of the empire to prevent them from doing so.

In 720, Wang believed that the Pugu (僕固) and Xiedie tribes of the region were planning to defect to Eastern Tujue and attack with Eastern Tujue troops.  He thus held a feast and invited the chieftains, and, at the feast, massacred them.  He then attacked the Pugu and Xiedie tribes in the area, nearly wiping them out.  He then proposed a plan to attack Ashina Mojilian along with the Baximi, Xi, and Khitan.

02/16/2024 06:01:27 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: Diphthongs are /ai/, /oi/, /eu/, /au/ and /ou/. Vowel sequences that begin with a lax mid vowel (i.e. /ɔ/ or /ɛ/) cannot be diphthongs and are always disyllabic.  Phonotactics  Adang syllable structure is (C)V(C). V can either be a monophthong or a diphthong. C can be almost any consonant. Exceptions are /f/, which never occurs in syllable final position, and /d͡ʒ/, which only ever occurs in final position. /s/ and /g/ only occur syllable-finally in specific categories of words (i.e. loanwords and onomatopoeic words, resp.).  Grammar  Syntax  Clauses in Adang are predicate-final: intransitive verbal predicates have Subject-Verb order and transitive predicates follow Agent-Patient-Verb order. In ditransitive constructions the theme precedes the recipient. Adang has accusative alignment. Some sentence examples:  A nominal predicate also follows the subject (note that Adang does not use a copula):  Negation  A clause is negated by placing negator nanɛ or nɛnɛ after the predicate. Besides nanɛ there are two negative particles: ʔɛ and haʔai. ʔɛ is used to limit the scope of negator nanɛ by placing ʔɛ in front of the negated element. In this case nanɛ must still succeed the predicate:  Nanɛ may also be used on its own for rules or general prohibitions. Alternatively, ʔɛ at the end of a clause expresses a negative imperative (without nanɛ). Compare: . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

02/16/2024 06:01:27 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 2 unknown glyphs in sentence: With an allative prefix a verbs valency is increased by one argument. It indicates movement toward that argument. There are two sets of allative prefixes. Of the two allative paradigms the first set can turn verbs from intransitive to transitive, from transitive to ditransitive. The second set is only found on three verbs: lap ‘search’, lɔfɛ ‘call’ and tain ‘release’. An example from each set of prefixes:  Set 1:   Set 2:  Ablative prefixes  Ablative prefixes also increase the valency of a verb to indicate movement away from its referent. This movement may be physical or metaphorical. The collection of verbs that can have an ablative prefix is very limited and consists of five verbs: papaɲ ‘imitate’, mala ‘shy’, baroc ‘afraid’, tafuniŋ ‘hide’ and tɛʔɛŋ ‘run’.  Valency-increasing prefixes  Applicative prefix  Applicative prefix u- increases a verb’s valency by introducing a theme to a sentence.

02/16/2024 06:01:27 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 6 unknown glyphs in sentence: The causative prefix adds a ‘causer’ to a proposition, thereby increasing a verb’s valency. There are only ten intransitive verbs that may carry a causative prefix. These include muj ‘fall down’, mih ‘sit’ and tɔh ‘stand’. The prefix almost always occurs together with a pronominal prefix, which precedes it. The only exception is ʔɔl ‘fall over’. An example:  Serial verb constructions  Serial verb constructions are very common in Adang. Serial verb constructions consist of multiple verbs combined into a single predicate, and share arguments and features such as aspect and negation. Symmetrical serial verb constructions consist solely of verbs from open classes, while an SVC is asymmetrical when it contains one verb from a closed class, which must precede the other verb(s). Symmetrical SVCs describe a sequence of events or the manner of an event.  Asymmetrical serial verb constructions have several different uses, which are detailed below.  Comitative SVCs  Comitative constructions use the verb -ra ‘be with’ before the main verb.  Causative SVCs  In causative constructions the causative verb also precedes the main verb. Three verbs can be used in a causative SVC. These are -nɔʔ ‘affect’, -hou ‘command’ and -ɛn ‘give’. -ɛn means ‘help’ in a causative SVC:  Directional SVCs .

02/16/2024 06:01:27 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 8 unknown glyphs in sentence: In a directional serial verb construction an intransitive directional verb (e.g. sam ‘go (far)’, ma ‘come’) indicates the direction of an event. The directional verb precedes the main, open-class verb.  Instrumental SVCs  The instrumental serial verb construction is the only way in Adang to introduce an instrument argument. It uses the verb puin ‘hold’:  Theme SVCs  A theme may be introduced by adding med ‘take’ before the open-class verb. While this construction is common in everyday speech, the verb med is entirely optional.  Location and direction  Verbs are also used to indicate direction or location, often in serial verb constructions. They cannot be intransitive, as they must have a subject and a location argument.  The verb lɛ ‘to, towards’ also forms a part of directional and locational compound verbs, for instance talɛ ‘up on’ and adaŋlɛ ‘away from the speaker toward the mountain’.  Locative deictics in Adang are considered to be verbs, because they can occur in serial verb constructions and modify nouns. Locative deictics distinguish between proximal (ʔɔŋ ‘here’), distal above the speaker (tɔŋ ‘there (above)’), distal level with the speaker (mɔŋ ‘there (level)’) and distal below the speaker (pɔŋ ‘there (below)’).

02/16/2024 06:07:56 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 2 unknown glyphs in sentence: Sowilo (*sōwilō), meaning "sun", is the reconstructed Proto-Germanic language name of the s-rune (ᛊ, ᛋ).  The letter is a direct adoption of Old Italic (Etruscan or Latin) s (𐌔), ultimately from Greek sigma (Σ). It is present in the earliest inscriptions of the 2nd to 3rd century (Vimose, Kovel).  The name is attested for the same rune in all three Rune Poems. It appears as Old Norse and Old Icelandic Sól and as Old English Sigel.  Name  The Germanic words for "Sun" have the peculiarity of alternating between -l- and -n- stems, Proto-Germanic *sunnon (Old English sunne, Old Norse, Old Saxon and Old High German sunna) vs. *sōwilō or *sōwulō (Old Norse sól, Gothic sauil, also Old High German forms such as suhil). This continues a Proto-Indo-European alternation *suwen- vs. *sewol- (Avestan xᵛə̄ṇg vs. Latin sōl, Greek helios, Sanskrit surya, Welsh haul, Breton heol, Old Irish suil "eye"), a remnant of an archaic heteroclitic declension pattern that remained productive only in the Anatolian languages.  The Old English name of the rune, written sigel (pronounced ) is most often explained as a remnant of an otherwise extinct l-stem variant of the word for "Sun" (meaning that the spelling with g is unetymological), but alternative suggestions have been put forward, such as deriving it from Latin sigillum (assuming that the y is the unetymological element instead).

02/16/2024 06:09:13 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 2 unknown glyphs in sentence: There was presumably a third parameter in designing the vowel letters, not mentioned in the Haerye, namely choosing horizontal ㅡ ɨ as the graphic base of "closed" (rounded) ㅜ u and ㅗ o, and vertical ㅣ i as the base of "open" (unrounded) ㅓ ə and ㅏ a. The horizontal letters ㅡㅜㅗ ɨ u o represented back vowels  in the fifteenth century, as they do today, whereas the fifteenth-century sound values of ㅣㅓㅏ i ə a are uncertain. Some linguists reconstruct them as , respectively (and reconstruct obsolete ㆍ ʌ as ); others as  (with ㆍ ʌ as ). In the latter case, the vertical letters would have represented front vowels, the dot the sole central vowel, and the vowel harmony, described as "shallow" vs "deep", would have been one of vowel height, with the yang vowels lower than their yin counterparts.  A resemblance of Phags-pa ꡠ e to hangul ㅡ ɨ (both horizontal lines), and of Phags-pa ꡡ o to hangul ㅗ o (both horizontal lines with an upper point in the middle), would back up Ledyard's theory if a connection were proven.

02/16/2024 06:09:13 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 5 unknown glyphs in sentence: Although several of the basic concepts of the Korean alphabet may have been inherited from Indic phonology through the Phags-pa script, such as the relationships among the homorganic consonants, Chinese phonology played a major role. Besides the grouping of letters into syllables, in functional imitation of Chinese characters, Ledyard argues that it was Chinese phonology, not Indic, that determined which five consonants were basic, and were therefore to be retained from Phags-pa. These included the plain stop letters, ꡂ g  for ㄱ g , ꡊ d  for ㄷ d , and ꡎ b  for ㅂ b , which were basic to Chinese theory, but which represented voiced consonants in the Indic languages and were not basic in the Indic tradition. The other two letters were the plain sibilant ꡛ s  for ㅈ j  (ㅈ was pronounced  in the fifteenth century, as it still is in North Korea) and the liquid ꡙ l  for ㄹ l . .

02/16/2024 06:09:13 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: The five adopted letters were graphically simplified, retaining the outline of the Phags-pa letters but with a reduced number of strokes that recalled the shapes of the speech organs involved, as explained in the Haerye. For example, the box inside Phags-pa ꡂ g  is not found in the Korean ㄱ g ; only the outer stroke remains. In addition to being iconic for the shape of the "root" of the tongue, this more easily allowed for consonant clusters and left room for an added stroke to derive the aspirated consonant ㅋ k . But in contrast to the Haerye account, the non-stops  ng , ㄴ n , ㅁ m , and ㅅ s  were derived by removing the top stroke or strokes of the basic letters. (No letter was derived from ㄹ l .) This clears up a few points that had been problematic in the Haerye. For example, while it is straightforward to derive ㅁ m from ㅂ b by removing the top of ㅂ b in Ledyard's account, it is not clear how one would derive ㅂ b by adding something to ㅁ m, since ㅂ b is not analogous to the other stops: If ㅂ b were derived as in the Haerye account, it would be expected to have a horizontal top stroke similar to those of ㄱ g , ㄷ d , and ㅈ j . .

02/16/2024 06:09:13 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 4 unknown glyphs in sentence: In order to maintain the Chinese convention of initial and rime, Sejong and his ministers needed a null symbol to refer to the lack of a consonant with an initial vowel. He chose the circle ㅇ with the subsequent derivation of the glottal stop ㆆ  , by adding a vertical top stroke by analogy with the other stops, and the aspirate ㅎ h , parallel the account in the Haerye. (Perhaps the reason he created a new letter rather than adopting one from Phags-pa was that it was awkward to write these Chinese initials in Phags-pa, where ㅇ and ㆆ were both written as digraphs beginning with y, ꡭꡝ and ꡗꡖ.) .

02/16/2024 06:09:13 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: However, Ledyard's explanation of the letter ㆁ ng  differs from the Haerye account; he sees it as a fusion of velar ㄱ g and null ㅇ, reflecting its variable pronunciation. The Korean alphabet was designed not just to write Korean, but to accurately represent Chinese. Many Chinese words historically began with , but by Sejong's day this had been lost in many regions of China, and was silent when these words were borrowed into Korean, so that  only remained at the middle and end of Korean words. The expected shape of a velar nasal, the short vertical stroke (⃓) that would be left by removing the top stroke of ㄱ g, had the additional problem that it would have looked almost identical to the vowel ㅣ i . Sejong's solution solved both problems: The vertical stroke left from ㄱ g was added to the null symbol ㅇ to create ㆁ ng, iconically capturing both regional pronunciations as well as being easily legible. Eventually the graphic distinction between the two silent initials ㅇ and ㆁ was lost, as they never contrasted in Korean words. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.
02/16/2024 06:09:13 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 4 unknown glyphs in sentence: Another letter composed of two elements to represent two regional pronunciations, now obsolete, was ㅱ, which transcribed the Chinese initial 微. This represented either m or w in various Chinese dialects, and was composed of ㅁ  plus ㅇ. In Phags-pa, a loop under a letter, ꡧ, represented  after vowels, and Ledyard proposes this rather than the null symbol was the source of the loop at the bottom, so that the two components of ㅱ reflected its two pronunciations just as the two components of ㆁ ng did. The reason for suspecting that this derives from Phags-pa ꡧ w is that the entire labio-dental series of both Phags-pa and the hangul, used to transcribe the Chinese initials 微非敷 w, v, f, have such composite forms, though in the case of Phags-pa these are all based on the letter ꡜ h (ꡤ etc.), while in hangul, which does not have an h among its basic consonants, they are based on the labial series ㅁ m, ㅂ b, ㅍ p.  An additional letter, the 'semi-sibilant' ㅿ z, now obsolete, has no explanation in either Ledyard or the Haerye. It also had two pronunciations in Chinese, as a sibilant and as a nasal (approximately  and ) and so, like ㅱ for  and ㆁ for , may have been a composite of existing letters. .

02/16/2024 06:09:13 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: As a final piece of evidence, Ledyard notes that, with two exceptions, hangul letters have the simple geometric shapes expected of invention: ㄱ g  was the corner of a square, ㅁ m  a full square, ㅅ s  a chevron, ㅇ a circle. In the Hunmin Jeong-eum, before the influence of the writing brush made them asymmetrical, these were purely geometric. The exceptions were ㄷ d  and ㅂ b , which had more complex geometries and were two of the forms adopted from Phags-pa. For example, ㄷ d  wasn't a simple half square, but even in the Hunmin Jeong-eum had a lip protruding from the upper left corner, just as Phags-pa ꡊ d did, and as Tibetan ད d did before that.  If the Phags-pa theory is valid, then the graphic base of Hangul consonants is part of the great family of alphabets that spread from the Phoenician alphabet, through Aramaic, Brāhmī, and Tibetan (though the derivation of Brahmi from Aramaic/Phoenician is also tenuous; see the Semitic-model hypothesis for Brahmi). However, this is only one component of its derivation: Hangul did not derive from Phags-pa in the gradual and unconscious way that the Latin alphabet derived from the Greek.

02/16/2024 06:15:56 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 15 unknown glyphs in sentence: The above continues the younger futhark rune order. Although this order was still used in the medieval period, it became increasingly common to arrange the runes in the order of the Latin alphabet. The names listed come from the manuscripts Stowe MS 57 and AM 461 12o with slight alteration. The name meanings are inferred from the Norwegian and Icelandic rune poems.   A hallmark of medieval runes was the optional sting or bar diacritic which was often used to indicate when a rune stands for a secondary sound; ᚡ gave /v/, ᚤ gave /y/ and /ø/, ᚧ gave /ð/, ᚵ gave /g/ and /ɣ/, ᛂ gave /e/ and rarely /j/, ᛑ gave /d/, ᛔ gave /p/. Of these, ᚡ and ᚧ were rarer than the other stung runes, and show up later in the timeline.  It was common for additional runes beyond the stock sixteen to be used. ᛕ existed as an alternative to ᛔ. Although originally the same rune, ᚮ and ᚯ split, and so did ᛆ and ᛅ, thereby increasing the number of vowel runes.  Three additional stung runes are found on Gotland, though two of them are only attested in one inscription.  See also List of runestones  Notes  References Enoksen, Lars Magnar (1998).

It is a syncretic mixture of Buddhist and Hindu practices with local traditional beliefs in mainland southeast Asia. Tai folk religion was a dominant native religion in mainland Southeast Asia until the arrival of Buddhism and Hinduism.   Tai folk animist traditions are practiced by the various Tai ethnic groups (such as Lao, Ahom, Shan, Dai, Khamti, Isan, Central Thai etc.). These religions are animistic and polytheistic and their practice involves classes of shamans and ancestor worship. However they have a more syncretic nature and are partially Buddhist in nature.

She also served as the royal messenger of the high god El, her probable father. Her most common epithets in the Ugaritic corpus are nrt ỉlm špš ("Shapshu, lamp of the gods", also translated as "torch" or "luminary" of the gods by various authors), rbt špš ("great lady Shapshu"), and špš ʿlm ("eternal Shapshu"). In the pantheon lists KTU 1.118 and 1.148, Shapshu is equated with the Akkadian dšamaš.  Name  The original name of the goddess contained the consonant /m/, and this consonant appears in some of the Amorite theophoric names mentioning the goddess. In the Middle Bronze Age Alalah, a process of devoicing and denasalization of the consonant /m/ made it, as a result, a /p/; this process is only attested at Middle Bronze Age Alalaḫ and at Late Bronze Age Ugarit. While name in Alalah show a mixture of the forms (Shamshu and Shapshu), in Ugarit there is not one attestation, syllabic or alphabetic, to the form "Shamshu".

02/16/2024 06:22:14 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 3 unknown glyphs in sentence: The 17th-15th century BCE cylinder seal AO 20138 depicts a female deity radiating wave-like solar rays, thought to be either Shapshu or the Hittite Sun goddess of Arinna. Azize favours an identification of the figure as Shapshu due to the absence of the Sun Goddess of Arinna's characteristic headgear and the presence of two mountain peaks he interprets as the twin peaks of Mount Sapan.  In Iron Age Phoenicia The sun god in iron age Phoenicia is consistently written as šmš (Phoenician: 𐤔𐤌𐤔), rather than špš, and is attested in both male and female forms. A seventh century BCE Phoenician bowl from the Etruscan Bernadini tomb at Palestrina and the 'Phoenician Ivory of Shapash' both depict a female sun goddess, though the sun cult at Baalbek centred on a male deity. Azize suggests that cultural influence from Mesopotamia or the Greek cult of Helios may have led to identification of the god as male.  Funerary inscriptions such as the 6th century BCE Sarcophagus of Eshmunazar II make reference to tḥt šmš, "life under the sun", interpreted as referring to ephemeral life on the Earth, but also an eternal sun (šmš ʿlm, recalling the epithet špš ʿlm) as on the Shipitbaal inscription from Byblos, a symbol of eternity and the relation between the living and the dead. .

02/16/2024 06:24:44 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 8 unknown glyphs in sentence: Fjörgyn (or Jörð; Old Norse 'earth') is a personification of earth in Norse mythology, and the mother of the thunder god Thor, the son of Odin. The masculine form Fjörgynn is portrayed as the father of the goddess Frigg, the wife of Odin.  Both names appear in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and in the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. A number of theories surround the names and they have been the subject of scholarly discourse.  Name  Etymology  The Old Norse name Fjörgyn is used as a poetic synonym for 'land' or 'the earth' in skaldic poems. It stems from Proto-Germanic *fergunja, meaning 'mountain', perhaps 'mountainous forest', which may ultimately derive from Proto-Indo-European *per-kwun-iyā ('the realm of Perkwunos'; i.e., the wooden mountains). Fjörgyn is cognate with the Gothic fairguni (𐍆𐌰𐌹𐍂𐌲𐌿𐌽𐌹), the Old English firgen, both meaning 'mountain', and with the Old High German Firgunnea, the Ore Mountains.

The Nabataean Kingdom controlled many of the trade routes of the region, amassing large wealth and drawing the envy of its neighbors. It stretched south along the Tihamah into the Hejaz, up as far north as Damascus, which it controlled for a short period (85–71 BC).  Nabataea remained an independent political entity from the mid-3rd century BC until it was annexed in AD 106 by the Roman Empire, which renamed it Arabia Petraea.  History  Nabataeans  The Nabataeans were one among several nomadic Bedouin Arab tribes that roamed the Arabian Desert and moved with their herds to wherever they could find pasture and water. They became familiar with their area as seasons passed, and they struggled to survive during bad years when seasonal rainfall diminished.   The precise origin of the specific tribe of Arab nomads remains uncertain. One hypothesis locates their original homeland in today's Yemen, in the southwest of the Arabian peninsula, but their deities, language and script share nothing with those of southern Arabia. Another hypothesis argues that they came from the eastern coast of the peninsula. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.
02/16/2024 06:33:13 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 2 unknown glyphs in sentence: Old Polish (Pre 1500) Poles began writing in the 12th century using the Latin alphabet. This alphabet, however, was ill-equipped to deal with Polish phonology, particularly the palatal consonants (now written as ś, ź, ć, dź), the retroflex group (now sz, ż, and cz) as well as the nasal vowels (now written as ą, ę). Consequently, Polish spelling in the Middle Ages was highly inconsistent as writers struggled to adapt the Latin alphabet to the needs of the Polish language. There was no unified system; different writers came up with different systems before the modern Polish orthography was firmly established.   In the earliest documents the letter c could signify c, cz, or k while the letter z was used for ś, z, ź, and ż. Writers soon began to experiment with digraphs (combinations of letters), new letters (ꟁ and ſ), and eventually diacritics.  1440 Reform Jakub Parkoszowic (Jacobus Parcossii) in 1440 was the first to attempt to introduce an orthographic reform titled Traktat o ortografii polskiej (Treatise on Polish Orthography) that was ultimately failed and wasn't rediscovered until 1830.  In it he suggests the use of doubling vowels to represent vowel length, a feature of Old and Middle Polish.

02/16/2024 06:33:51 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: Queen of Heaven was a title given to a number of ancient sky goddesses worshipped throughout the ancient Mediterranean and the ancient Near East. Goddesses known to have been referred to by the title include Inanna, Anat, Isis, Nut, Astarte, and possibly Asherah (by the prophet Jeremiah). In Greco-Roman times, Hera and Juno bore this title. Forms and content of worship varied.  Inanna  Inanna was the Sumerian goddess of love and war. Despite her association with mating and fertility of humans and animals, Inanna was not a mother goddess and is rarely associated with childbirth. Inanna was also associated with rain and storms and with the planet Venus. The Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa, believed to have been compiled around the mid-seventeenth century BCE, referred to  the planet Venus in the tablet as the "bright queen of the sky" or "bright Queen of Heaven".  Although the title of Queen of Heaven was often applied to many different goddesses throughout antiquity, Inanna is the one to whom the title is given the most number of times. In fact, Inanna's name is commonly derived from Nin-anna which literally means "Queen of Heaven" in ancient Sumerian (It comes from the words NIN meaning "lady" and AN meaning "sky"), although the cuneiform sign for her name (Borger 2003 nr. 153, U+12239 𒈹) is not historically a ligature of the two. .

Complex ranked Bob among the "25 Most Badass Fat Guys in Games" in 2011. In 2012, Jeff Marchiafava of Game Informer deemed Bob one of the most "ridiculous" Tekken characters: "Bob is from America. Bob is also morbidly obese. That's pretty much all the thought Namco put into Bob."

02/16/2024 06:38:21 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 4 unknown glyphs in sentence: Scholars have suggested different theories for the origin of the name Kurd. According to the 19th century English Orientalist Godfrey Rolles Driver, the term Kurd is related to the Sumerian Karda which was found from Sumerian clay tablets of the third millennium B.C, while according to other scholars, it predates the Islamic period, as a Middle Persian word for "nomad", and may ultimately be derived from an ancient toponym or tribal name, either that of the Cyrtii or of Corduene, and mainstream academic opinion favours the Kurds being descended from Corduene.  Name There are different theories about the origin of the name Kurd. According to one theory, it originates in Middle Persian as 𐭪𐭥𐭫𐭲 kwrt-, a term for "nomad; tent-dweller". After the Muslim conquest of Persia, this term is adopted into Arabic as kurd, and was used specifically of nomadic tribes.  As for the Middle Persian noun kwrt- originating in an ancient toponym, it has been argued that it may ultimately reflect a Bronze Age toponym Qardu, Kar-da, which may also be reflected in the Arabic (Quranic) toponym Ǧūdī (re-adopted in Kurdish as Cûdî).  From the 7th century onwards, the name Kurd is better known, since the Arabs used it often (al Akrad).    . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

As a rule, therefore, it is advantageous to consider the entire IT system and not just individual systems within the scope of an IT security analysis and concept. To be able to manage this task, it makes sense to logically partition the entire IT system into parts and to separately consider each part or even an IT network. Detailed documentation about its structure is prerequisite for the use of the IT Baseline Protection Catalogs on an IT network.

Several IT applications can run on an IT system. When this occurs, the application with the greatest need for protection determines the IT systems protection category.  Conversely, it is conceivable that an IT application with great protection needs does not automatically transfer this to the IT system. This may happen because the IT system is configured redundantly, or because only an inconsequential part is running on it. This is called the (distribution effect). This is the case, for example, with clusters.  The baseline security check maps baseline protection measures. This level suffices for low to medium protection needs. This comprises about 80% of all IT systems according to BSI estimates.

Amun was attested from the Old Kingdom together with his wife Amunet. With the 11th Dynasty ( 21st century BC), Amun rose to the position of patron deity of Thebes by replacing Montu.  After the rebellion of Thebes against the Hyksos and with the rule of Ahmose I (16th century BC), Amun acquired national importance, expressed in his fusion with the Sun god, Ra, as Amun-Ra (alternatively spelled Amon-Ra or Amun-Re). On his own, he was also thought to be the king of the gods.  Amun-Ra retained chief importance in the Egyptian pantheon throughout the New Kingdom (with the exception of the "Atenist heresy" under Akhenaten). Amun-Ra in this period (16th to 11th centuries BC) held the position of transcendental, self-created creator deity "par excellence"; he was the champion of the poor or troubled and central to personal piety. With Osiris, Amun-Ra is the most widely recorded of the Egyptian gods. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

Ra ruled in all parts of the created world: the sky, the Earth, and the underworld. He was believed to have ruled as the first pharaoh of Ancient Egypt. He was the god of the sun, order, kings and the sky.  Ra was portrayed as a falcon and shared characteristics with the sky-god Horus. At times the two deities were merged as Ra-Horakhty, "Ra, who is Horus of the Two Horizons". In the New Kingdom, when the god Amun rose to prominence he was fused with Ra as Amun-Ra.  The cult of the Mnevis bull, an embodiment of Ra, had its center in Heliopolis and there was a formal burial ground for the sacrificed bulls north of the city.  All forms of life were believed to have been created by Ra. In some accounts, humans were created from Ra's tears and sweat, hence the Egyptians call themselves the "Cattle of Ra".

Its opposite is the X mark ("✗" or "×").  Extended system It is common in Japan to employ other symbols to express non-binary grading beyond just "yes/no" or "right/wrong."

By grounding the architecture in the business of the organization, the TEAF defines the core business procedures and enterprise processes. Through its explicit models, a TEAF-based architecture enables the identification and reasoning of enterprise- and system-level concerns and investment decisions.  History  The Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework (TEAF) is derived from earlier treasury models, such as the US Treasury model (TISAF) released 1997, and the Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF), released in 1999. The first version of the TEAF was released July 2000.  In the new millennium the Treasury Enterprise Architecture Framework (TEAF) has developed into the Treasury Enterprise Architecture (TEA), which aims to establish a roadmap for the modernization and optimization of the U.S. Treasury Department's business processes and IT environment. The Treasury Enterprise Architecture will provide a framework to guide IT investment planning, streamline systems, and ensure that IT programs align with business requirements and strategic goals.

The final 𒆠 () is a determinative indicating that the previous signs are to be understood as a place name.  Archibald Sayce, writing in the 1870s, postulated that the Semitic name was a loan-translation of the original Sumerian name.  However, the "gate of god" interpretation is increasingly viewed as a Semitic folk etymology to explain an unknown original non-Semitic placename. I. J. Gelb in 1955 argued that the original name was Babilla, of unknown meaning and origin, as there were other similarly named places in Sumer, and there are no other examples of Sumerian place-names being replaced with Akkadian translations. He deduced that it later transformed into Akkadian , and that the Sumerian name Kan-dig̃irak was a loan translation of the Semitic folk etymology, and not the original name. The re-translation of the Semitic name into Sumerian would have taken place at the time of the "Neo-Sumerian" Third Dynasty of Ur. (Bab-Il). .

The only information available about him comes from Josephus’s citation of the Phoenician author Menander of Ephesus, in Against Apion i.18. The entire passage about the four brothers is as follows, as given in Whiston’s translation: Now four sons of (Abdastartus’s) nurse plotted against him and slew him, the eldest of whom reigned twelve years; after them came Astartus the son of Deleastartus: he lived fifty-four years, and reigned twelve years; after him came his brother Aserymus; he lived fifty-four years, and reigned nine years: he was slain by his brother Pheles, who took the kingdom and reigned but eight months, though he lived fifty years: he was slain by Ithobalus, the priest of Astarte.  The dates given for Astarymus (Aserymus) are according to the work of F. M. Cross and other scholars who take 825 BC as the date of Dido’s flight from her brother Pygmalion, after which she founded the city of Carthage in 814 BC.

The only information available about Abdastartus comes from the following citation of the Phoenician author Menander of Ephesus, in Josephus's Against Apion i.18: Upon the death of Hirom, Beleazarus his son took the kingdom; he lived forty-three years, and reigned seven years: after him succeeded his son Abdastartus; he lived twenty-nine years, and reigned nine years. Now four sons of his nurse plotted against him and slew him.  Therefore, according to Menander/Josephus, Abdastartus began to reign seven years after the death of his grandfather, Hiram I. The dating of Hiram and the following kings is based on the studies of J. Liver, J. M. Peñuela, F. M. Cross, and William H. Barnes, all of whom build on the inscriptional evidence of a synchronism between Baal-Eser II and Shalmaneser III in 841 BC. Earlier studies that did not take this inscriptional evidence into consideration will have differing dates for the kings of Tyre.

Because it is almost entirely alphanumeric, it is far more compatible with other programs that do not support Unicode, and more readily typed by hand. However, the text created by using USD encoding is far less legible, and in fact, more closely resembles Leet. Another problem is that because not all letters fit well, the USD algorithms cannot be a complete involution (i.e., completely convertible back and forth) and contain a complete set of letters at the same time. For instance, the Albartus USD algorithm example seen in the "Examples" section below has k, T, t, and R still in their upright positions. Another issue with USD encoding is the use of italic type. The letter "a" will, in most typefaces using italic fonts, render it as a "one-story" Latin alpha, thus causing problems with any word using that letter as a lowercase "e." Oblique type does not have this problem.  Below is a conversion table that can be used to transform lowercase, uppercase numeric and punctuation output.

The region of Nubia was an early cradle of civilization, producing several complex societies that engaged in trade and industry. The city-state of Kerma emerged as the dominant political force between 2450 and 1450 BC, controlling the Nile Valley between the first and fourth cataracts, an area as large as Egypt. The Egyptians were the first to identify Kerma as "Kush" and over the next several centuries the two civilizations engaged in intermittent warfare, trade, and cultural exchange.  Much of Nubia came under Egyptian rule during the New Kingdom period (1550–1070 BC). Following Egypt's disintegration amid the Late Bronze Age collapse, the Kushites reestablished a kingdom in Napata (now modern Karima, Sudan). Though Kush had developed many cultural affinities with Egypt, such as the veneration of Amun, and the royal families of both kingdoms occasionally intermarried, Kushite culture, language and ethnicity was distinct; Egyptian art distinguished the people of Kush by their dress, appearance, and even method of transportation. .

The understanding of the concept has changed over the centuries, and varies between different schools of Buddhism and different regions. A range of views on the attainment of arhats existed in the early Buddhist schools. The Sarvāstivāda, Kāśyapīya, Mahāsāṃghika, Ekavyāvahārika, Lokottaravāda, Bahuśrutīya, Prajñaptivāda, and Caitika schools all regarded arhats as imperfect in their attainments compared to buddhas.  Mahayana Buddhist teachings urge followers to take up the path of a bodhisattva, and to not fall back to the level of arhats and śrāvakas. The arhats, or at least the senior arhats, came to be widely regarded by Theravada buddhists as "moving beyond the state of personal freedom to join the Bodhisattva enterprise in their own way". .

Some form of temple to Ningirsu probably existed from the early days of the city. Sumerian gods were generally associated with particular cities and Ningirsu means "Lord of Girsu".

Attested from the 9th century BC, the Qedarites formed a powerful polity which expanded its territory over the course of the 9th to 7th centuries BC to cover a large area in northern Arabia stretching from Transjordan in the west to the western borders of Babylonia in the east, before later moving westwards during the 6th to 5th centuries BC to consolidate into a kingdom stretching from the eastern limits of the Nile Delta in the west till Transjordan in the east and covering much of southern Palestine, the Sinai Peninsula and the Negev.  The Qedarites played an important role in the history of the Levant and of North Arabia, where they enjoyed close relations with the nearby Canaanite and Aramaean states, and became important participants in the trade of spices and aromatics imported into the Fertile Crescent and the Mediterranean world from South Arabia. Having engaged in both friendly ties and hostilities with the Mesopotamian powers such as the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian empires, the Qedarites eventually became integrated within the structure of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. Closely associated with the Nabataeans, the Qedarites might have eventually been absorbed by them. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

History   The Trấn Quốc Pagoda in Hanoi is the oldest pagoda in the city, originally constructed in the sixth century during the reign of Emperor Lý Nam Đế (from 544 until 548), thus giving it an age of more than 1,500 years. When founded the temple was named Khai Quốc (National Founding) and was sited on the shores of the Red River, outside of the Yên Phụ Dyke. When confronted with the river's encroachment, the temple was relocated in 1615 to Kim Ngư (Golden Fish) islet of Hồ Tây (West Lake) where it is now situated. A small causeway links it to the mainland. The last major repair to the temple was undertaken in 1815 when the main sanctuary, reception hall and posterior hall of the dead were renovated.   The pagoda is one of the main parts of the Trấn Quốc Temple for it holds the important monk's ashes. Most of the pagodas were made in the 17th century.  Monks have lived at the Trấn Quốc Pagoda for centuries, teaching the ways of Buddhism to the public. Before the visitors start arriving, the monks pray at the multiple shrines spread around the grounds. Monks do not get married and therefore do not live with families at the pagoda. .

Gottlieb illustrates the fifth principle accordingly: "Community strength is built on the strength of the organizations that serve it, however  most of the work being done by community benefit organizations is being done with an attitude of scarcity and weakness. This scarcity assumption yields a focus on what will bring in money and what aspects of the organization are in a crisis state. When the scarcity assumption is replaced with an assumption of strength, the whole world changes: 'can't' becomes 'possibility'."  6. Individuals will go where systems lead them.  The book constructs the sixth principle along these lines: "None of the standard systems used by this sector  planning, governance, development etc. - are  aimed at potential. These systems primarily focus on reactive or incremental change vs. creating a proactive, extraordinary future for our communities. Individuals and groups will go where the systems point them. What is needed are systems that set high expectations and inspire decisions that aim towards those expectations."  Governance  . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

He was a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  Biography Fan was born in Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province, China. His father, named Fan Qi (樊琦, 1879—1947), served in the district courts of Jinhua and Wenzhou. Ky Fan went to Jinhua with his father when he was eight years old and studied at several middle schools in Zhejiang, including the Jinhua High School (currently Jinhua No.1 Middle School), Hangzhou Zongwen High School (currently Hangzhou No.10 Middle School), and Wenzhou High School. Fan obtained his secondary diploma from the Jinhua High School.  Fan enrolled into Peking University Department of Mathematics in 1932, and received his B.S. degree from Peking University in 1936. Initially Fan wanted to study engineering, but eventually shifted to mathematics, largely because of the influence of his uncle Feng Zuxun (冯祖荀, 1880–1940; b. Hangzhou, d. Beijing), who was a mathematician in China and the then Chair of the Department of Mathematics of Peking University. After graduation, Fan became a teaching assistant in the department. .

He was regarded as a source of both divine and human kingship, and opens the enumerations of deities in many Mesopotamian texts. At the same time, his role was largely passive, and he was not commonly worshipped. It is sometimes proposed that the Eanna temple located in Uruk originally belonged to him, rather than Inanna, but while he is well attested as one of its divine inhabitants, there is no evidence that the main deity of the temple ever changed, and Inanna was already associated with it in the earliest sources. After it declined, a new theological system developed in the same city under Seleucid rule, resulting in Anu being redefined as an active deity. As a result he was actively worshipped by inhabitants of the city in the final centuries of the history of ancient Mesopotamia. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

02/16/2024 08:04:17 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 5 unknown glyphs in sentence: According to Gerard Clauson, the Turkic word tu:ğ, for traditional Turkic standards made from horse-tails or bunches of horse-hair, was borrowed from Middle Chinese *dok 纛 "banner, standard" (whose ancestor is Old Chinese *du:g (ZS) ~ dˤuk and one of whose many descendants is standard Chinese dú). In contrast, according to linguist Sevan Nişanyan, the author of the first etymological dictionary of Turkish, it is more likely in terms of cultural history that the Chinese word tu or dú is borrowed from Turkic or Mongolic.  Annemarie von Gabain (1955) (apud Maenchen-Helfen, 1973) was inclined to derive Chinese 纛 *duok from Turkic *tuɣ; however, Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen thought that the loan direction had been apparently from Chinese into Turkic, as 纛 (GS 1016) was the same as 翿 dào < d'âu < d'ôg, "staff with feathers" (GS 1090z) 斿 (variant of 旒) liú ~ yóu < iâu < diôg "pendants of a banner" (GS 1080a) 游  liú ~ yóu < "pennon" (GS 1080f), which had been attested in the Classic of Poetry and Zuo Zhuan, centuries before the first appearance of the allegedly Turkic-speaking Xiongnu. Chinese observers stated that the medieval Göktürks displayed a tuğ decorated with a wolf's head at their camp's gate in order not to forget their origin from a she-wolf ancestress. A Western Turkic tribal confederation, the Duolu, was possibly named after tuğ, if Old Turkic Tuğluğ (𐱃𐰆𐰍𐰞𐰍), which was "mentioned in the Chinese annals under various names: Duolu MChnL tuet-lǐuk[...], Dulu 都陸 MChnL tuǝ-liwk, Duolu 咄禄 MChnL tuet-luk", means "have flags (banners), have standards"..

Nghề khôn khéo chật khắp phương trời, Càng ngày văn minh càng rộng, tranh cạnh lợi quyền. Đất càng ngày càng rộng, dân giàu nước mạnh. Nước càng ngày càng thịnh, của có thêm người khôn.  2.  Người Nam Quốc, một giống Tiên Rồng, Thiệt giòng giai nhân tài tử, xưa rày gọi là nước tài ba. Nền văn hiến, nặn đúc anh hùng, Sẵn tài thông minh trời dựng, thêm nghề học hành. Học càng ngày càng tiến, nghề nghiệp mở rộng. Nước càng giàu càng mạnh, nòi giống thêm vẻ vang.  3.  Này Âu Á, gặp lúc phong trào, Sẵn thấy gia công rèn tập, trăm nghề nghiệp đều biết đều hay. Đường tiến hóa chạy suốt Tam Kỳ, Càng ngày non sông càng đẹp, cám ơn bù trì.. Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

Tuttul is identified with the archaeological site of Tell Bi'a in Raqqa Governorate, northern Syria. Tell Bi'a is located near the modern city of Raqqa and the confluence of the rivers Balikh and Euphrates.  History During the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2000–1600 BCE), Tuttul was a sacred city to the god Dagan, who was a supreme god in the region of Mari, Terqa and Tuttul, and worshipped across the Ancient Near East. However, the settlement at Tell Bi'a had been occupied since the mid-3rd millennium BCE. This town has sometimes also been called the "Northern Tuttul" with reference to an implied "Southern Tuttul", which was possibly located on the Iraqi Euphrates between the ancient cities of Mari and Babylon. However, this is a debated issue. The identification of the so-called "Southern Tuttul" with modern Hit is uncertain, as Hit is referenced to several times in the Mari archives via its modern name.

Of these, it is conjectured that several glyphs came about due to copying errors. In particular, 妛 was probably created when printers tried to create 𡚴 by cutting and pasting 山 and 女 together. A shadow from that process was misinterpreted as a line, resulting in 妛 (a picture of this can be found in the Jōyō kanji jiten).  Unification of kanji variants  According to the specifications in the fourth standard (1997),  is the action of giving the same code point to a character without regard to its different character forms. In the fourth standard, the glyphs allowed are limited; the extent to which particular allographic glyphs are unified into a graphemic code point is clearly defined.  Furthermore, according to the specifications in the standard, a  is an abstract notion as to the graphical representation of a graphic character; a  is the representation as a graphical shape that a glyph takes in actuality (e.g. due to a glyph being handwritten, printed, displayed on a screen, etc.).

The name "Tiele" was first interpreted as "Tölis" by Édouard Chavannes and Vilhelm Thomsen, but this was pointed out as inaccurate in 1937 by Cen Zhongmian, as Tölis applied to the Turkic title of official (突利失 Tulishi) in the east that also came to be attached to the Xueyantuo qaghan. Some scholars (Haneda, Onogawa, Geng, etc.) proposed that Tiele, Dili, Dingling, Chile, Tele, & Tujue all transliterated underlying Türk; however, Golden proposed that Dili, Dingling, Chile, Tele, & Tiele transliterated Tegrek while Tujue transliterated Türküt, plural of Türk. The appellation Türük (Old Turkic: 𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰰) ~ Türk (OT: 𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰚) (whence Middle Chinese 突厥 *dwət-kuɑt > *tɦut-kyat > standard Chinese: Tūjué) was initially reserved exclusively for the Göktürks by Chinese, Tibetans, and even the Turkic-speaking Uyghurs. In contrast, medieval Muslim writers, including like Ottoman historians like Mustafa Âlî and explorer Evliya Çelebi as well as Timurid scientist Ulugh Beg, often viewed Inner Asian tribes, "as forming a single entity regardless of their linguistic affiliation" commonly used Turk as a generic name for Inner Asians (whether Turkic- or Mongolic-speaking).

References of the tribes in the remote areas west of the Pamir Mountains were sparse and mentioned only in passing, some tribes like the Alans were probably erroneously added. By the end of the 6th century nothing more was known about them. Those tribes in the eastern areas (north of China and near Lake Baikal), such as the Guligan (骨利干), Duolange (多览葛) Xijie (奚结) and Baixi (白霫) were being rewarded afterward, though a few like the Fuluo (覆罗), Mengchen (蒙陈) and Turuhe (吐如纥) disappeared. Fuluo (覆羅) were possibly linked to the 伏利(具) Fuli(-ju) in Book of Sui, the 匐利(羽) Fuli(-yu) in Tanghuiyao and the Bökli-Çöligil (𐰋𐰇𐰚𐰲𐰃:𐰲𐰇𐰠𐰏𐰠) on Kul Tigin inscription.  According to some researchers (Onogawa, 1940; Duan, 1988; Lung, 2011; Davis, 2008; Tang, 2009; etc.), the Göktürks' leading Ashina clan were descended from the Tiele tribe by ancestral lineage. Like the Göktürks, the Tiele were probably one of many nomadic Turkic peoples on the steppe. However, Lee & Kuang (2017) state that Chinese histories did not describe the Ashina-led Göktürks as descending from the Dingling or belonging to the Tiele confederation. .

02/16/2024 08:32:11 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 6 unknown glyphs in sentence: Taito, daito, or otodo (𱁬/) is a kokuji ("kanji character invented in Japan") written with 84 strokes, and thus the most graphically complex CJK character—collectively referring to Chinese characters and derivatives used in the written Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages. This rare and complex character graphically places the 36-stroke tai 䨺 (with tripled 雲 "cloud"), meaning "cloudy", above the 48-stroke tō 龘 (tripled 龍 "dragon") "appearance of a dragon in flight". The second most complicated CJK character is the 58-stroke Chinese biáng (𰻞/), which was invented for Biangbiang noodles "a Shaanxi-style Chinese noodle".  Composition The Chinese character components for taito are both compound ideographs created by reduplicating a common character, namely the 12-stroke Japanese kumo or Chinese yún 雲 "cloud" (with the "rain radical" 雨 and un or yún 云 phonetic), and the 16-stroke "dragon radical" Japanese ryū or Chinese lóng 龍. The 雲 "cloud" character is tripled into 36-stroke tai or duì 䨺 "cloudy" and quadrupled into 48-stroke dō or nóng 𩇔 "widely cloudy"; the 龍 "dragon" character is interchangeably doubled or tripled into 32- or 48-stroke tō or dá 龖 or 龘 "appearance of a dragon in flight" and quadrupled into 64-stroke tō or zhé 𪚥 "chattering; be garrulous". .

Lexicographer Jack Halpern (1981: 73) similarly said, "The essence of the scheme is that the formation of Chinese characters can be likened to the way atoms combine to form the more complex molecules of compounds." The American linguist Michael Carr (1986: 79) examined the best-case example of semantic "crystal characters" invented by repeating a radical, much like atoms forming crystal patterns—in the sense of rì 日 the "sun radical" in chāng 昌 "sunlight; prosperous", xuān 昍 "bright", and jīng 晶 "bright; crystal". Carr (1986: 82-3) further distinguished "natural" crystal characters that occur in standard, written Chinese (citing the above example of dá 龖 "appearance of a dragon in flight" from the 龍 "dragon radical") versus "synthetic" or "artificial" ones that are restricted to Chinese dictionaries (dá 龘 "appearance of a dragon in flight" and zhé 𪚥 "chatter"), which "are graphic ghosts from previous dictionaries, and unattested in actual usage."

That said, there's very little not to like about NBA 2K9. Player animations are outstanding, Association mode is deep, online options are plentiful, and the gameplay is terrific. If you're a baller, this is the game for you." IGN's Nate Ahearn said of the PC, PS3, and Xbox 360 versions: "NBA 2K9 is [a] basketball game for the purists out there and has plenty for diehard basketball fans to enjoy. At a price of $19.99 I can almost forgive the absence of multiplayer, especially when you consider how much game there is still is to play. There are tidbits built in to appease casual fans, but theres no question that with things like Bird Years making their way into this years game that 2K9 is made for aficionados. Even still, anyone who has seen a pro game will be able to find the similarities and the finite details that make NBA 2K9 the best game in town." .

02/16/2024 08:45:25 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: In ancient written Chinese, the character for chopsticks was zhu (; Middle Chinese reconstruction: d̪jwo-). Although it may have been widely used in ancient spoken Chinese, its use was eventually replaced by the pronunciation for the character kuài (), meaning "quick". The original character, though still used in writing, is rarely used in modern spoken Chinese. It, however, is preserved in Chinese dialects such as Hokkien and Teochew, as the Min Chinese languages are directly descended from Old Chinese rather than Middle Chinese.  The Standard Chinese term for chopsticks is kuàizi (). The first character () is a pictophonetic (semantic-phonetic) compound created with a phonetic part meaning "quick" (), and a semantic part meaning "bamboo" (), using the radical (⺮).  The English word "chopstick" may have derived from Chinese Pidgin English, in which chop chop meant "quickly". According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the earliest published use of the word is in the 1699 book Voyages and Descriptions by William Dampier: "they are called by the English seamen Chopsticks".

PSG encountered few problems against Nantes, relegated from the French top-flight last season, with defender Sammy Traoré nodding "Les Parisiens" in front from a Clément Chantôme free-kick before Serbian striker Mateja Kežman made sure of victory shortly before half-time. Just two weeks before the start of the Ligue 1 season, PSG continued their pre-season preparation with a draw against a physical Greek side from Panthrakikos. Invited by Italian outfit Fiorentina, PSG attended the Memorial Artemio Franchi and stole the show scoring three unanswered goals, including Mevlüt Erdinç's first goal for new club Paris Saint-Germain, confirming that Antoine Kombouaré's squad was in tip top form just ten days from the start of the campaign. Paris attended Arsenal's Emirates Cup for the second time and suffered their first of the pre-season at the hands of Rangers in their opening match. New striker Mevlüt Erdinç, a 10 million signing from Sochaux, spurned a host of first-half chances for "Les Parisiens", who found themselves on the back foot for much of the first period. Paris Saint-Germain showed great character in coming back to equalize while playing a man down against Atlético Madrid in the second day of the tournament. The pre-season lived up to all its promise and was certainly a positive outing for Antoine Kombouaré's side.. Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

02/16/2024 08:55:56 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 2 unknown glyphs in sentence: Warea carteri is an annual herb, 0.2 to 1.5 m tall with erect green stems. The plants usually have many slender, ascending branches forming an open, rounded crown. The leaves lack stipules and are arranged alternately on the stem. Lower leaves are lost by the time the plant flowers. Leaf size and shape varies with age and position on the plant. At the time of flowering, leaf petioles range from 0.8 to 3.9 mm with blades 1 to 3 cm long. Towards the tips of stems, the leaves are smaller and narrowly elliptical to almost linear, while closer to the bases of stems and branches, the leaves are larger and oblanceolate or spatulate. All leaves are rounded at the tip, their margins entire, and their bases attenuate to cuneate. The lower leaves can also be undulate, margined or lobed. The many inflorescences of W. carteri are dense, rounded racemes with many flowers (60 or more). The flowers are radially symmetric, with four white linearoblanceolate sepals, about 4.5 mm long, and curved toward the center of the flower at the tip. The four petals are white, about 6.0 mm long, with more than half their length in the form of a slender claw. The petal's blade is nearly round with irregular margins. The six spreading stamens are irregularly subequal in length and arise from a nectar-producing floral disc. The ovary is superior, cylindric, about 2.3 mm long, and raised on a slender stalk (gynophore) about 2 mm long. The sessile stigma has two lobes. W. carteri is protandrous: the anthers begin to dehisce within an hour or two after the flower has opened. The stigmas are receptive until 2 to 4 days afterwards, by which time the stamens on that flower have dropped. Warea carteris fruit is a silique, long, slender pod divided lengthwise by a partition (septum). The pod is flattened, cylindrical in cross-section and gently curved along its length, which is 4 to 6 cm long and 1.5 mm wide. The pod is borne on a gynophore, which is a stalk-bearing pistil 5 to 6 mm long, above a spreading pedicel, which is around 8.5 mm long.  The pod carries numerous oblong seeds, each 1.5 mm long Fruits split apart passively to shed the seeds.. Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.
02/16/2024 08:55:56 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence:  Taxonomy Warea carteri was named by Small in 1909. A review of the genus by Channel and James in 1964 retained Small's treatment of the species. There are no scientific synonyms. Other common names for the species include Carter's warea, and Carter-warea.  Distribution From what is known of the historic distribution of W. carteri, it occurred in scrubby flatwoods and sandhills of the Lake Wales Ridge in Highlands, Polk, and Lake counties, in South Florida Slash Pine forests of the Miami area in Miami-Dade County, and in coastal scrub in Brevard County. It has been found in yellow sand scrub at Lake Wales Ridge State Forest. The current known distribution of W. carteri includes Highlands, Polk, and Lake counties on the Lake Wales Ridge in central Florida.

02/16/2024 08:55:56 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 3 unknown glyphs in sentence: Experiments have demonstrated that Warea carteri is self-pollinating, autogamous, and self-compatible. Autogamy and self-compatibility allow isolated or sparsely distributed individuals to reproduce. Natural levels of fruit- and seed-set are quite high, with a fruit-set of 62 percent, and seed-set of 50 percent. Self-pollinated flowers showed significantly lower fruit- and seed-set, 41 percent fruit-set and 28 percent seed-set. This indicates that insect-mediated pollination is important in keeping fruit- and seed-set high, and individual fecundity high. Pollinators appear to be the limiting factor in fruit and seed production. Because aboveground populations fluctuate wildly, autogamy helps ensure fecundity and may be a key life history trait. Germination in W. carteri occurs in late winter through early spring (January–March). Flowering occurs in September and October. Fruiting occurs in October and November, and dispersal follows in November and early December. Preliminary observations of insect activity on W. carteri indicate it is a generalist with respect to pollination. A great diversity of insects visit the flowers, including native solitary bees, bumblebees, syrphids (known as hoverflies or bee-flies), wasps, flies, beetles, etc. Within-plant movements by insects appear to predominate over among-plant movements. Because of this, and in combination with the close proximity of male and female flowers in an inflorescence, self-pollination probably is a regular method of reproduction in this species. There are no obvious specialized forms of seed dispersal in W. carteri. The siliques do not open explosively; rather, the external walls of the fruit peel away from the central septum as the fruit slowly dries, exposing the mature seeds inside. The seeds drop passively to the ground or they may be flung a bit further if the plant is brushed. It is not likely that seeds are moved by wind once they reach the ground. Collection or movement of seeds of W. carteri by ants or other animals has not been studied, but there are no obvious specialized structures on the seed that would encourage such movement. Large fluctuations observed in above ground population size suggest the possibility that seed banking plays a significant role in W. carteris biology. Environmental cues necessary for germination were explored experimentally at Archbold Biological Station. Moisture and light were found to be necessary for germination. The use of an oak leachate did not significantly affect germination. Some seeds stored in dry, dark conditions for 2 years germinated, demonstrating the potential of W. carteris seeds to remain dormant at least that long. Fire-related cues such as heat do not stimulate germination, but germination does require light and seeds may remain dormant for more than 2 years..

02/16/2024 08:55:56 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 2 unknown glyphs in sentence: Warea carteri was listed as an endangered species in 1987 due to habitat loss (52 FR 2234). The primary threats to W. carteris persistence are habitat destruction and fire suppression. On the Lake Wales Ridge, W. carteri is threatened primarily by the conversion of its habitat to citrus groves or residential subdivisions. In Highlands County, 64.2 percent of the xeric vegetation (sand pine scrub, scrubby flatwoods, and southern ridge sandhills) present before settlement was converted to other land uses by 1981. An additional 10.3 percent of the xeric vegetation was moderately altered, primarily by building roads to create residential subdivisions (Peroni and Abrahamson 1985). The situation is similar in Polk and Lake counties. Fire suppression has been in practice throughout W. carteris range for many decades. Fire suppression is a threat to this species because its demography and reproduction seem to be closely tied to fire. The historical distribution of W. carteri includes the sites of at least 14 herbarium collections made in what is now the Miami urban area in Miami-Dade County, from 1878 to 1934. Nearly all of the suitable habitat for the plant in this area has been altered by urban growth. The remaining tracts of native vegetation have been searched carefully in recent years.ec The plant is almost certainly extirpated from the county. Warea carteri has probably been extirpated from Brevard County as well as no specimens have been observed in recent years. The status of the two largest populations of W. carteri in central Florida (at Archbold Biological Station and Tiger Creek Preserve) has been monitored for 6 years (M. Evans, Archbold Biological Station, personal communication 1995). Extreme fluctuations of population size are observed year to year. The data accumulated on population sizes indicate a strong relationship with fire. W. carteri seems to respond quickly, strongly, and positively to fire. Major population increases and the discovery of new populations consistently occur 1 year after fire, while major population crashes, including the appearance of no above ground individuals, occur 2 years after fire. The demography of W. carteri is being studied at Archbold Biological Station, Tiger Creek Preserve, and the Lake Placid Scrub. Dozens of local patches are known from Archbold Biological Station and Tiger Creek Preserve, although not all patches have aboveground plants in any given year. At both Archbold Biological Station and Tiger Creek Preserve, many W. carteri populations have behaved fairly predictably in response to fire. Populations either appear or boom the year following fire (11 of 16 instances of population doubling at Tiger Creek Preserve occurred the year after a fire). Population crashes occur in the second year (18 of 26 populations at Tiger Creek Preserve lost more than 50 percent 2 years post fire). Populations in sites that have experienced prolonged fire suppression usually persist only in very low above ground densities. Warea carteri is currently protected at Archbold Biological Station, Lake Placid Scrub, Tiger Creek Preserve, Lake Wales Ridge SF, Snell Creek and Horse Creek. Polk County. BLM is in contact with the SFWMD and FWS to determine the best course of action to pursue in order to protect and manage W. carteri at this site..

Players can also form a quad using four of the same tile.  Making groups by calling (melding) Players can make a meld (open group) by calling for another player's discard. They reveal the meld on the table and then make their own discard. Calling for another player's discard makes the group and the hand open. When a winning tile of a closed hand is a discard, the group including that discard is also considered open, while the hand is still regarded as closed.

02/16/2024 09:05:13 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 2 unknown glyphs in sentence: The root and meaning of the Tovi name is very ancient, with the clearest link for an older origin being found in the dedication on the Sønder Vissing Runestone. The carvings describe the stone as having been raised by Tófa, in memory of her mother. The first character of her name is ᛏ, the Rune for Týr, a Northern European deity thought to be of early origins in an Indo-European Pantheon. He was a sky god, god of justice, sacrifice and war. Later associations with Thor seen throughout the internet, in heraldry and publications, appear to have arisen not from evidence but from more modern speculations and probable confusion from the simplifications of multiple Norse deities. The dominance of Odin and Thor in the Norse pantheon coincides with the time that monotheistic religions such as Christianity were influencing and challenging the polytheism of the older cultures in Northern European regions. The letter V, often used as evidence that Tovi derives from a diminutive of a longer name was a Latinisation of the Rune ᚠ and Medieval additions to the Younger Futharc duplicated the use of some of the 16 Runic characters used in the 9th to 11th centuries. The Rune for V is the same as that used for F.  Pruda is from the Old Norse , meaning "proud/splendid fine; magnificent; stately; splendid; gallant; brave". .

The Old English word ān was derived from Proto-West Germanic *ain, which was derived from Proto-Germanic *ainaz. All of these words descended from Proto-Indo-European *óynos, meaning "single".  Distinction between a and an  The [n] of the original Old English indefinite article ān got gradually assimilated before consonants in almost all dialects by the 15th century.

Origins  The mountain is first mentioned in the final chapter of the Avataṃsaka Sūtra, the Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra, where the chapter's protagonist journeys to seek the advice of Avalokiteśvara.  The Japanese scholar Shu Hikosaka, on the basis of his study of Buddhist scriptures, ancient Tamil literary sources, as well as field surveys, proposed the hypothesis that the ancient Mount Potalaka, the residence of Avalokiteśvara described in the Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra and Xuanzang’s Great Tang Records on the Western Regions, is the real mountain Potikai or Potiyil situated near the town of Ambasamudram in the Tirunelveli District of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The mountain is located in an area within the Singampatti Zamindar Forest. Shu also says that Mount Potiyil/Potalaka has been a sacred place for the people of South India from time immemorial.  With the spread of Buddhism in the region beginning at the time of the great king Aśoka in the third century BCE, it became a holy place also for Buddhists who gradually became dominant as a number of their hermits settled there. The local people, though, mainly remained followers of Hinduism. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

The name of the woman in the inscription, Auðgerðr or Ödgärd, is also mentioned on another memorial runestone, U 821, which is located in Mysinge, Uppland. As U 821 is located approximately two miles from U 839, it is possible that both runestones refer to the same woman, although there is no other evidence of this besides the same name being used in the text.

Its location on the confluence of the River Liffey and the Rye Water has marked it as a frontier town historically: on the border between the ancient kingdoms of Leinster and Brega, as an outpost of The Pale, and on Kildare's border with County Dublin. Leixlip was also a civil parish in the ancient barony of Salt North.  As of 2022, the population of the town was 16,773. It is the fifth largest town in Kildare, and the 30th largest in Ireland.  Name The placename comes from the Old Norse lax hlaup (Younger Futhark: ᛚᛅᚼᛋ ᚼᛚᛅᚢᛒ; ) which means "salmon leap". The name in the Irish language (Léim an Bhradáin) is a direct translation of this, and was first adopted in the 1890s. In Latin, it is Saltus salmonis, from which comes the names of the baronies of North Salt and South Salt.  History Leixlip was a possible site of the Battle of Confey, in which the Viking King Sigtrygg Caech of Dublin defeated the Irish King of Leinster around the year 917. The first settlement at Leixlip was an outpost of Early Scandinavian Dublin, built at the furthest point where longships could be rowed up the Liffey. Its status as an outpost of Dublin continued for centuries, marking a border of The Pale. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

Resistance to Alexander the Great Some time before the Battle of Issus (modern-day Turkey), Sabaces left Egypt with his army to join Darius III in Syria and support him in his fight against Alexander the Great. When the Battle of Issus took place (November 333 BC) Alexander and his horsemen fought their way through the enemy troops until they came in close vicinity to Darius III, whose life was therefore threatened. Darius III was protected by the most noble Persians, among them also Sabaces, who was killed:  The Persian king fled because he feared for his life; therefore the Macedonians won the battle.  Successor Mazaces was probably the successor of Sabaces in Egypt, but because Sabaces had taken with him nearly all occupying forces, Mazaces was not able to organize military resistance against the Macedonians. Therefore, Alexander the Great was able to take Egypt without fighting (332 BC).  Notes  References    Waldemar Heckel: Who’s who in the age of Alexander the Great.

They are placed either horizontally or vertically to represent any integer or rational number.  The written forms based on them are called rod numerals.  They are a true positional numeral system with digits for 1–9 and a blank for 0, from the Warring states period (circa 475 BCE) to the 16th century.  History Chinese arithmeticians used counting rods well over two thousand years ago.   In 1954 forty-odd counting rods of the Warring States period (5th century BCE to 221 BCE) were found in Zuǒjiāgōngshān (左家公山) Chu Grave No.15 in Changsha, Hunan.  In 1973 archeologists unearthed a number of wood scripts from a  tomb in Hubei dating from the period of the Han dynasty (206 BCE to 220 CE). On one of the wooden scripts was written: "当利二月定算𝍥". This is one of the earliest examples of using counting-rod numerals in writing.

02/16/2024 09:41:26 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 9 unknown glyphs in sentence: Baku: The name Baku is widely believed to be derived from the old Persian names of the city  Bād-kube, meaning "Wind-pounded city", in which bād means "wind" and kube is rooted in the verb  kubidan, "to pound", thus referring to a place where wind is strong and pounding. Indeed, the city is renowned for its fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds. It is also believed that Baku refers to Baghkuh, meaning "Mount of God". 𐎲𐎠𐎥𐎠 Baga and 𐎣𐎠𐎢𐎳𐎠 kaufa (now kuh) are the Old Persian words for "god" and "mountain" respectively; the name Baghkuh may be compared with Baghdād ("God-given") in which dād is the Old Persian word for "give". Arabic sources refer to the city as Baku, Bakukh, Bakuya, and Bakuye, all of which seem to come from a Persian name.Various different hypotheses were also proposed to explain the etymology of the word Baku. According to L.G. Lopatinski and Ali Huseynzade Baku is derived from Turkic word for "hill". Caucasian history specialist K.P. Patkanov also explains the name as "hill" but in the Lak language. The Turkish Islamic Encyclopedia presents the origin of the word Baku as being derived from the words Bey-Kyoy, which mean "the main city" in Turkic. Also another theory suggests that the name Baku is derived from the ancient Caucasian Albanian city called Baguan.. Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.
02/16/2024 09:41:26 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 3 unknown glyphs in sentence: Riga: One theory for the origin of the name Riga is that it is a corrupted borrowing from the Liv ringa meaning loop, referring to the ancient natural harbour formed by the tributary loop of the Daugava. The other is that Riga owes its name to this already-established role in commerce between East and West, as a borrowing of the Latvian rija, for warehouse, the "j" becoming a "g" in Germannotably, Riga is called Rie by English geographer Richard Hakluyt (1589), and German historian Dionysius Fabricius (1610) confirms the origin of Riga from rija. Another theory could be that Riga was named after Riege, the German name for the River Rīdzene, a tributary of the Daugava.  : Beirut: Derived from Phoenician word 𐤁𐤓𐤕 "Be’rot" meaning "fountain." Cognate with the Hebrew ביירות, lit. "the wells", from בארות "be'erot", plural of בְּאֵר "be'er" ("well"). Similarly, this word exists in the Arabic singular for "well" (بئر), implying an early Semitic root.  : Maseru: "Place of the Red Sandstone" in Sesotho. Thaba Bosiu (July 1824 – March 11, 1969): "Mountain of Night" in Sesotho.

It is apparently a finite verb inflected in the past third person singular, though the stem remains entirely uncertain, as does the subject of the verb. Suggestions include  or  'greeted',  'gave', and  'spoke'. Accordingly, the second line of the inscription has been variously interpreted as reading "Daþina greeted you", "(He) greeted you, Daþïna", "I, Daþina, spoke [the charm]", "Then Dalena spoke [the charm]", or "To you, Dalena, (he) gave [presents]".

This may disappoint some of his longtime fans, but it will more than likely gain him far more fans than he will lose."  Finally, Tyler Hess of Christian Music Zine frankly stated "The Chase is Manafest’s fourth label release and it appears that he has learned to mix up his hip hop with some rock, some boy band ballads and most importantly enough diversity to keep an entire album interesting enough throughout, with a pace fast enough that The Chase feels like its over before it's really begun.  Maybe it isn't really fitting with the trends, going back in time instead of pushing forward, but if you can let that go then you can probably still enjoy the latest from Manafest."

02/16/2024 09:44:44 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: The unusual bond angle in disiloxane has been attributed primarily to negative hyperconjugation between oxygen p orbitals and silicon–carbon σ* antibonding orbitals, p(O) → σ*(Si􏰉–R), a form of π backbonding. A secondary and much smaller contribution to the silicon–oxygen bond in disiloxanes involves π backbonding from oxygen 2p orbitals to silicon 3d orbitals, p(O) → d(Si). Because of this interaction, the Si–O bonds can exhibit some partial double bond behavior and the oxygen atoms are much less basic than in the carbon analogue, dimethyl ether.  In addition to studies of bond angles, vibrational analyses have also been done to determine the symmetry elements of disiloxane. IR and Raman spectroscopy have been used to propose a point group of D3d.  While disiloxane itself has a bent molecular geometry at oxygen, the related compound hexaphenyldisiloxane, Ph3Si–O–SiPh3, has an Si–O–Si angle of 180°.  Synthesis  Synthesis of disiloxane is typically done by taking a hydrosilane species with a substituent leaving group and reacting it with water to produce silanol. The silanol is then reacted with itself to produce the final disiloxane through dehydrative coupling. This is shown in the reactions below:  H3SiX + H2O → H3SiOH + HX (first step)  2 H3SiOH → H3SiOSiH3 + H2O (second step) . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

The lake is not a natural one, and was created in 1758 by Robert Young, who had purchased the land from William Penn to operate an iron forge. The Den Brook was dammed up to create a lake which was fed with a constant supply of "the purest water". In 1884, the club had 50 members, the initiation fee was  $25.00, and yearly dues were $10.00. The guest register was quite impressive containing the names of many very wealthy men and prominent politicians. There were congressmen, senators, educators including the president of Rutgers University and even presidents who visited Shongum.  During the depression, membership dropped and the Cutler family sold the club building after it had been in the family for 100 years. It became the property of Benjamin Bragman and was used as a dwelling. In 1974 it was acquired by the Shongum Lake Property Owners Association and is used once again for club functions and private parties.

The Anga Lipi finds its mention in the Buddhist text "Lalitvistar" which says Anga lipi was the one of the script among the 64 scripts known to Lord Budhha.  Etymology and history The Anga Script is mentioned in an ancient Sanskrit language Buddhist book the "Lalitvistar", which names Anga Lipi relatively early in the list of 64 scripts known to the Buddha. Arthur Coke Burnell thought that some of the sixty-four scripts mentioned in "Lalitvistar" were mythical, but he considered some, including Dravid, Anga and Banga, to be real, though not appearing as distinct alphabets until the 9th or 10th century CE. (Burnell regarded this passage as a late interpolation.)  Characteristics and comparison Anga Lipi and Bengali script might have been derived from Brahmic, with some regional characteristics. This supports the belief that the development of local characteristics in alphabets was continuing from earlier times.  It reflects the early development of local variants of Indian alphabets.

On one occasion he was attacked and beaten by a band of extremists as a result of his public discourse. In 1923 he was one of the founders of the League for Human Rights, working as its secretary. As a lawyer he pleaded, in 1925 at Turnu-Severin, against nationalist Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, leader of the anti-Semite Iron Guard, who had assassinated the prefect of Iaşi. However, as a result of the powerful lobby of the nationalist organisation, Codreanu was ultimately acquitted. Another contribution was in defending the rebels of Tatarbunary Uprising during the famous 1925 "Trial of the 500".  Costa-Foru was also one of the Romanian pioneers in the business of mineral and oil exploration, contributing to the creation of the first Romanian Coal Company (1903).

After Sun Xiu's death, however, Puyang Xing did not assist the underage Sun Wan in becoming the new emperor. Around the time, as Eastern Wu faced several threats (e.g. external invasion, internal uprisings), the officials hoped for an older and more mature emperor to lead them. Wan Yu then used the opportunity to recommend Sun Hao to Puyang Xing and the general Zhang Bu – the regents in the interim period – to be the new emperor, in the hope that he would be rewarded later. He told Puyang Xing and Zhang Bu that Sun Hao was wise, decisive and similar to Sun Ce (a founding father of Eastern Wu), and managed to persuade them to help Sun Hao.

He was the son of king Abdsamiya and is attested by nine inscriptions discovered at Hatra. Only two of these inscription bear year datings, both are hard to read.(perhaps 231 and 237/38)  Sanatruq II appears in Syrian sources as Sanatru and in Arab sources as Daizian and Satirun. One of his inscriptions was found on a statue showing him standing. His wife was perhaps Abbu. There are two sons known. Abdsamiya was named after his grandfather. He was his heir. Another son, Mana is attested in year 235 and seems to have had Arabia of Wal under his control, a region southeast of Edessa. From the latter evidence it seems that Sanatruq II expanded his territory. The daughter Duspari is known from a statue, dated to year 549 (= AD 238). A second statue belongs to her daughter Samay.  Under Sanatruq II Hatra became a vassal of the Romans. Around AD 226/227 the Sassanians attacked the city without success, but was finally conquered and destroyed by the Sassanians, perhaps around AD 240/41.

He is known from more than 20 inscriptions found at Hatra and reigned from about 140 to 180. Only one of his inscriptions is dated (year 176/177). He was the son of Naṣru who governed Hatra from about 128 to 140. Sanatruq I was one of the first rulers of Hatra calling himself 𐣬𐣫𐣪 malka ("king"), but he bears also the title 𐣬𐣣𐣩𐣠 mry'  (administrator). He was granted the title of king by his Parthian overlord Vologases IV (), due to the increasing strategic importance of the city during that period. Indeed, during the 2nd-century Hatra blossomed, serving as an important religious and commercial centre. The city was well fortified, previously successfully containing the attacks of the Roman emperor Trajan () thrice. Hatra would remain a dependency of the Parthians until the emergence of the Sasanian Empire in 224. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

He was the grandson of Eshmunazar I, and a vassal king of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. Eshmunazar II succeeded his father Tabnit I who ruled for a short time and died before the birth of his son. Tabnit I was succeeded by his sister-wife Amoashtart who ruled alone until Eshmunazar II's birth, and then acted as his regent until the time he would have reached majority. Eshmunazar II died prematurely at the age of 14. He was succeeded by his cousin Bodashtart.    Eshmunazar II came from a lineage of priests of Astarte, and his rule saw a strong emphasis on religious activities.

Lotan seems to have been prefigured by the serpent Têmtum represented in Syrian seals of the 18th–16th century BC,  and finds a later reflex in the sea monster Leviathan, whose defeat at the hands of Yahweh is alluded to in the biblical Book of Job and in Isaiah 27:1.  Lambert (2003) went as far as the claim that Isaiah 27:1 is a direct quote lifted from the Ugaritic text, correctly rendering Ugaritic bṯn "snake" as Hebrew nḥš "snake".  Lotan (ltn) is an adjectival formation meaning "coiled", here used as a proper name; the same creature has a number of possible epitheta, including  "the fugitive serpent" (bṯn brḥ) and maybe (with some uncertainty deriving from manuscript lacunae) "the wriggling serpent" (bṯn ʿqltn) and "the mighty one with seven heads" (šlyṭ d.šbʿt rašm). .

Since antiquity, tandoors have been used to bake unleavened flatbreads, such as  roti and naan, as well as to roast meat. The tandoor is predominantly used in Western Asian, Central Asian, South Asian, and Horn of African cuisines.  The roots of the tandoor can be traced back over 5,000 years to the ancient Indus Valley Civilization, one of the oldest known civilizations. The standard heating element of a tandoor is an internal charcoal or wood fire, which cooks food with direct heat and smoke. Tandoors can be fully above ground, or partially buried below ground, often reaching over a meter in height/depth. Temperatures in a tandoor can reach , and they are routinely kept lit for extended periods. Therefore, traditional tandoors are usually found in restaurant kitchens. Modern tandoors are often made of metal. Variations, such as tandoors with gas or electric heating elements, are more common for at-home use.

02/16/2024 11:15:24 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence: Skull symbolism is the attachment of symbolic meaning to the human skull. The most common symbolic use of the skull is as a representation of death.  Humans can often recognize the buried fragments of an only partially revealed cranium even when other bones may look like shards of stone. The human brain has a specific region for recognizing faces, and is so attuned to finding them that it can see faces in a few dots and lines or punctuation marks; the human brain cannot separate the image of the human skull from the familiar human face. Because of this, both the death and the now-past life of the skull are symbolized.  Hindu temples and depiction of some Hindu deities have displayed association with skulls.  Moreover, a human skull with its large eye sockets displays a degree of neoteny, which humans often find visually appealing—yet a skull is also obviously dead, and to some can even seem to look sad due to the downward facing slope on the ends of the eye sockets. A skull with the lower jaw intact may also appear to be grinning or laughing due to the exposed teeth. As such, human skulls often have a greater visual appeal than the other bones of the human skeleton, and can fascinate even as they repel. Societies predominantly associate skulls with death and evil.  Unicode reserves character U+1F480 (💀) for a human skull pictogram.  Examples.

This includes the adjustment of characters with radical 162 by replacing the two-dot form ⻍ (4 strokes in dictionaries) with its one-dot form ⻌ (3 strokes in dictionaries) in printing typefaces. This simplification was then inherited by the less mandatory jōyō kanji () policy. This change did not happen among hyōgai kanji (Chinese characters not covered by jōyō kanji). In the 2010 revision of jōyō kanji, however, included several hyōgai kanji in the new version of jōyō kanji table, causing inconsistency in the printing form of radical 162 among commonly used Chinese characters in Japanese. Moreover, in the 1983 version of JIS coded kanji character sets, ⻍ in some hyōgai kanji were also simplified; This change was partially reverted in its newer versions. The 2010 Revised Jōyō Kanji Table stipulates that despite the inconsistency in the printing forms, this radical character should always be written with one dot.  In mainland China, the replacement of the two-dot ⻍ with one-dot ⻌ (3 strokes in dictionaries) happens when the xin zixing (new typeface) was popularized.

02/16/2024 11:27:28 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 14 unknown glyphs in sentence: Harald "Bluetooth" Gormsson (; , died c. 985/86) was a king of Denmark and Norway.  He was the son of King Gorm the Old and of Thyra Dannebod. Harald ruled as king of Denmark from c. 958 – c. 986. Harald introduced Christianity to Denmark and consolidated his rule over most of Jutland and Zealand. Harald's rule as king of Norway following the assassination of King Harald Greycloak of Norway was more tenuous, most likely lasting for no more than a few years in the 970s. Some sources say his son Sweyn Forkbeard forcibly deposed him from his Danish throne before his death.  Name   Harald's name is written as runic haraltr : kunukʀ (ᚼᛅᚱᛅᛚᛏᚱ ᛬ ᚴᚢᚾᚢᚴᛦ) in the Jelling stone inscription. In normalized Old Norse, this would correspond to Haraldr konungr, i.e. "Harald king". The Latinized name as given in the medieval Danish chronicles is Haraldus Gormonis filius (Harald, Gorm's son). The given name Haraldr (also Haralldr) is the equivalent of Old English Hereweald, Old High German Heriwald, from hari "army" and wald- "rule"..

02/16/2024 11:27:52 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 3 unknown glyphs in sentence:   The distinction between /i/, /ji/ and /jɪ/ is rarely indicated in writing and must be inferred from reconstructions of Proto-Slavic. In Glagolitic, the three are written as <ⰻ>,  <ⰹ>, and <ⰺ> respectively. In Cyrillic, /jɪ/ may sometimes be written as ı, and /ji/ as ї, although this is rarely the case.   Yers preceding *j became tense, this was inconsistently reflected in writing in the case of *ь (ex: чаꙗньѥ or чаꙗние, both pronounced [t͡ʃɑjɑn̪ije]), but never with *ъ (which was always written as a yery).    Yery was the descendant of Proto-Blato-Slavic long *ū and was a high back unrounded vowel.  Tense *ъ merged with *y, which gave rise to yery's spelling as <ъи> (later <ꙑ>, modern <ы>).   The yer vowels ь and ъ (ĭ and ŭ) are often called "ultrashort" and were lower, more centralised and shorter than their tense counterparts *i and *y. Both yers had a strong and a weak variant, with a yer always being strong if the next vowel is another yer. Weak yers disappeared in most positions in the word, already sporadically in the earliest texts but more frequently later on. Strong yers, on the other hand, merged with other vowels, particularly ĭ with e and ŭ with o, but differently in different areas. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

Its iotated variant was often confused with *ě (in Glagolitic they are even the same letter: Ⱑ), so *a was probably fronted to *ě when it followed palatal consonants (this is still the case in Rhodopean dialects).   The exact articulation of the nasal vowels is unclear because different areas tend to merge them with different vowels. ę /ɛ̃/ is occasionally seen to merge with e or ě in South Slavic, but becomes ja early on in East Slavic. ǫ /ɔ̃/ generally merges with u or o, but in Bulgaria, ǫ was apparently unrounded and eventually merged with ъ.

Ctesiphon served as a royal capital of the Iranian empire in the Parthian and Sasanian eras for over eight hundred years. Ctesiphon was capital of the Sasanian Empire from 226–637 until the Muslim conquest of Persia in 651 AD.  Ctesiphon developed into a rich commercial metropolis, merging with the surrounding cities along both shores of the river, including the Hellenistic city of Seleucia. Ctesiphon and its environs were therefore sometimes referred to as "The Cities" (Aramaic: Mahuza, , al-Mada'in). In the late sixth and early seventh century, it was listed as the largest city in the world by some accounts.  During the Roman–Parthian Wars, Ctesiphon fell three times to the Romans, and later fell twice during Sasanian rule. It was also the site of the Battle of Ctesiphon in 363 AD. After the Muslim invasion, the city fell into decay and was depopulated by the end of the eighth century, its place as a political and economic center taken by the Abbasid capital at Baghdad.

A letter by Ishbara Qaghan to Emperor Wen of Sui in 585 described him as "the Great Turk Khan". The Bugut (584 CE) and Orkhon inscriptions (735 CE) use the terms Türküt, Türk and Türük.  During the first century CE, Pomponius Mela refers to the Turcae in the forests north of the Sea of Azov, and Pliny the Elder lists the Tyrcae among the people of the same area. However, English archaeologist Ellis Minns contended that Tyrcae Τῦρκαι is "a false correction" for Iyrcae Ἱύρκαι, a people who dwelt beyond the Thyssagetae, according to Herodotus (Histories, iv. 22), and were likely Ugric ancestors of Magyars. There are references to certain groups in antiquity whose names might have been foreign transcriptions of Tür(ü)k, such as Togarma, Turukha/Turuška, Turukku and so on; but the information gap is so substantial that any connection of these ancient people to the modern Turks is not possible. .

Scholars, including Toru Haneda, Onogawa Hidemi, and Geng Shimin believed that Di, Dili, Dingling, Chile and Tujue all came from the Turkic word Türk, which means 'powerful' and 'strength', and its plural form is Türküt. Even though Gerhard Doerfer supports the proposal that türk means 'strong' in general, Gerard Clauson points out that "the word türk is never used in the generalized sense of 'strong'" and that türk was originally a noun and meant "'the culminating point of maturity' (of a fruit, human being, etc.), but more often used as an [adjective] meaning (of a fruit) 'just fully ripe'; (of a human being) 'in the prime of life, young, and vigorous'". Turkologist Peter B. Golden agrees that the term Turk has roots in Old Turkic, yet is not convinced by attempts to link Dili, Dingling, Chile, Tele, and Tiele, which possibly transcribed *tegrek (probably meaning 'cart'), to Tujue, which transliterated to Türküt. The Chinese Book of Zhou (7th century) presents an etymology of the name Turk as derived from 'helmet', explaining that this name comes from the shape of a mountain where they worked in the Altai Mountains. Hungarian scholar András Róna-Tas (1991) pointed to a Khotanese-Saka word, tturakä 'lid', semantically stretchable to 'helmet', as a possible source for this folk etymology, yet Golden thinks this connection requires more data..

Since the letter representing the same sound in Read's Quikscript appears identical to "Hung", it is doubtful that Read reversed the letter twice by mistake—he may have thought it best to leave things as they were, mistake or not, especially as a corrected /ng/ might in hasty or careless writing be confused with his new letter for /n/ in Quikscript.  Other reversals  Two other letters that are often alleged to have been reversed—intentionally or not—are Air and Err.

Canaan had significant geopolitical importance in the Late Bronze Age Amarna Period (14th century BC) as the area where the spheres of interest of the Egyptian, Hittite, Mitanni, and Assyrian Empires converged or overlapped. Much of present-day knowledge about Canaan stems from archaeological excavation in this area at sites such as Tel Hazor, Tel Megiddo, En Esur, and Gezer.  The name "Canaan" appears throughout the Bible as a geography associated with the "Promised Land". The demonym "Canaanites" serves as an ethnic catch-all term covering various indigenous populations—both settled and nomadic-pastoral groups—throughout the regions of the southern Levant or Canaan.

For example, the word nfr, "beautiful, good, perfect", was written with a unique triliteral that was read as nfr: nfr  However, it is considerably more common to add to that triliteral, the uniliterals for f and r. The word can thus be written as nfr+f+r, but one still reads it as merely nfr. The two alphabetic characters are adding clarity to the spelling of the preceding triliteral hieroglyph. .

02/16/2024 11:34:52 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 4 unknown glyphs in sentence: In Sumerian, the single word kur (𒆳) had two main meanings: 'hill' and 'country'.  Akkadian, however, had separate words for these two meanings: šadú 'hill' and mātu 'country'. When Sumerian cuneiform was adapted (known as orthographic borrowing) for writing Akkadian, this was ambiguous because both words were written with the same character (𒆳, conventionally transcribed KUR, after its Sumerian pronunciation). To alert the reader as to which Akkadian word was intended, the phonetic complement -ú was written after KUR if 'hill' was intended, so that the characters KUR-ú were pronounced šadú, whereas KUR without a phonetic complement was understood to mean mātu 'country'.  Phonetic complements also indicated the Akkadian nominative and genitive cases. Similarly, Hittite cuneiform occasionally uses phonetic complements to attach Hittite case endings to Sumerograms and Akkadograms.  Phonetic complements should not be confused with determinatives (which were also used to disambiguate) since determinatives were used specifically to indicate the category of the word they preceded or followed.  For example, the sign DINGIR (𒀭) often precedes names of gods, as LUGAL (𒈗) does for kings.  It is believed that determinatives were not pronounced.  In Japanese .

However, in adjectival verbs ending in -shii (-しい), and in those verbs ending in -ru (-る) in which this syllable drops in derived nouns, the final two syllables are written phonetically. There are also irregularities. For example, the word umareru 'be born' is derived from umu 'to bear, to produce'. As such, it may be written 生まれる [生mareru], reflecting its derivation, or 生れる [生reru], as with other verbs ending in elidable -ru.  In Phono-Semantic Characters  In Chinese Chinese never developed a system of purely phonetic characters. Instead, about 90% of Chinese characters are compounds of a determinative (called a 'radical'), which may not exist independently, and a phonetic complement indicates the approximate pronunciation of the morpheme. However, the phonetic element is basic, and these might be better thought of as characters used for multiple near homonyms, the identity of which is constrained by the determiner. Due to sound changes over the last several millennia, the phonetic complements are not a reliable guide to pronunciation. Also, sometimes it is not obvious at all where the phonetic complements reside, for instance, the phonetic complement in 聽 is 𡈼, in 類 is 頪, and in 勝 is 朕, etc.  In Vietnamese.

In the Maya Script  The Maya Script, the logosyllabic orthography of the Maya Civilization, used phonetic complements extensively and phonetic complements could be used synharmonically or disharmonically. The former is exemplified by the placement of the syllabogram for ma underneath the logogram for "jaguar" (in Classic Maya, BALAM): thus, though pronounced "BALAM", the word for "jaguar" was spelled "BALAM-m(a)".

This file is indexed by two previously reserved bytes in the file's (or directory's) directory entry at offset 0x14. In the FAT32 format, these bytes hold the upper 16 bits of the starting cluster number of the file or directory, hence making it impossible to store OS/2 EAs on FAT32 using this method.  However, the third-party FAT32 installable file system (IFS) driver FAT32.IFS version 0.70 and higher by Henk Kelder & Netlabs for OS/2, eComStation and ArcaOS stores extended attributes in extra files with filenames having the string "␠EA.␠SF" appended to the regular filename of the file to which they belong. The driver also utilizes the byte at offset 0x0C in directory entries to store a special mark byte indicating the presence of extended attributes to help speed up things. (This extension is critically incompatible with the FAT32+ method to store files larger than 4 GB minus 1 on FAT32 volumes.)

Historically there are close to 12,000 surnames recorded including those from non-Han Chinese ethnic groups, of which only about 3,100 are in current use, a factor of almost 4:1 (about 75%) reduction. A 2019 figure however put the total number of Chinese family names at 6,150. Of Han Chinese surnames, the largest number ever recorded was 6,363 (3,730 single-character surnames, 2,633 multiple-character surnames), around 2,000 of which are still in use.  Chinese Surname extinction is due to various factors, such as people taking the names of their rulers, orthographic simplifications, taboos against using characters from an emperor's name, and others. A recent example of near surname extinction is the rare surname Shan (𢒉). The character may not be displayed on computer systems used by government officials, and people born after the system change as well as people who want to avoid possible problems changed their name to another character such as Xian (冼).

Already during Aguda's rebellion against the Liao dynasty, all Jurchen fighters were mounted. It was said that the Jurchen cavalry tactics were a carryover from their hunting skills. Jurchen horsemen were provided with heavy armor; on occasions, they would use a team of horses attached to each other with chains (Guaizi Ma).  Ethnic Bohai were an important element of not only civil but military administration in the Jin dynasty from its earliest stages. After annexing the Bohai rebel regime of Gao Yongchang, the Jin moved to attract Bohai recruits by sending out two Bohai, Liang Fu (梁福) and Wodala (斡荅剌) to encourage their compatriots to join the Jin, using the slogan "Jurchen and Bohai are originally of the same family" (女真渤海本同一家). Da Gao (大㚖), a descendant of Bohai royalty, was a major military commander in the Jin, commanding 8 meng-an of Bohai troops, and excelled in battle against the Song army.

In England over time the word cash was adopted from Sanskrit कर्ष karsa, a weight of gold or silver but akin to the Old Persian 𐎣𐎼𐏁 karsha, unit of weight (83.30 grams). East India Company coinage had both Urdu and English writing on it, to facilitate its use within the trade. In 1671 the directors of the East India Company ordered a mint to be established at Bombay, known as Bombain. In 1677 this was sanctioned by the Crown, the coins, having received royal sanction, were struck as silver rupees; the inscription runs "The rupee of Bombaim", by the authority of Charles II.  At about this time coins were also being produced for the East India Company at the Madras mint. In Tamil term for money is kaasu may be this is the place where the word Kaasu may get modified into Cash. To be noted is here both the term 'Kaasu' and 'cash' has same meaning, not like money box or something else. The currency at the company's Bombay and Bengal administrative regions was the rupee. At Madras, however, the company's accounts were reckoned in pagodas, fractions, fanams, faluce and cash. This system was maintained until 1818 when the rupee was adopted as the unit of currency for the company's operations. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

The massif merges with the Sayan Mountains in the northeast, and gradually becomes lower in the southeast, where it merges into the high plateau of the Gobi Desert. It spans from about 45° to 52° N and from about 84° to 99° E.  The region is inhabited by a sparse but ethnically diverse population, including Russians, Kazakhs, Altais, Mongols, and Volga Germans, though predominantly represented by indigenous ethnic minorities of semi-nomadic people. The local economy is based on bovine, sheep, horse husbandry, hunting, agriculture, forestry, and mining. The Altaic language family takes its name from this mountain range.

The Balrog and other concepts in his writings derived from the Old English word Sigelwara, used in texts such as the Codex Junius to mean "Aethiopian". He wondered why the Anglo-Saxons would have had a word with this meaning, conjecturing that it had formerly had a different meaning. He emended the word to Sigelhearwan, and in his essay "Sigelwara Land", explored in detail the two parts of the word. He stated that Sigel meant "both sun and jewel", the former as it was the name of the Sun rune *sowilō (ᛋ), the latter connotation from Latin sigillum, a seal. He decided that Hearwa was related to Old English heorð, "hearth", and ultimately to Latin carbo, "soot". He suggested from all this that Sigelhearwan implied "rather the sons of Muspell than of Ham", a class of demons in Northern mythology "with red-hot eyes that emitted sparks and faces black as soot".

He is called Abimelech (meaning "father of the king") in the superscription of Psalm 34. It was probably this same king, or his son with the same name, described as "Achish, the son of Maoch", to whom David reappeared a second time at the head of a band of 600 warriors. The king assigned David to Ziklag, whence he carried on war against the surrounding tribes whilst lying to Achish that he was waging war against Israel to garner his support. Achish had great confidence in the valour and fidelity of David, but, at the objection of the other Philistine rulers, did not permit him to go to battle along with the Philistine hosts. David remained with Achish a year and four months. According to the Bible, in , David was greatly afraid of Achish because he was being recognized by the servants of Achish.

02/16/2024 11:47:24 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 3 unknown glyphs in sentence: Sheba (;  ;  ;  ) is an ancient kingdom mentioned in the Hebrew Bible and the Quran. It particularly features in the tradition of Orthodox Tewahedo in today's Ethiopia and is also asserted as the home of the Queen of Sheba, who is left unnamed in Jewish texts, but is known as Makeda in Ethiopian texts and as Bilqīs in Arabic texts. According to the Jewish historian Josephus, Sheba was the home of Princess Tharbis, who is said to have been the wife of Moses before he married Zipporah.  There is no consensus on the exact location of Sheba, though modern scholars have placed it in the general area spanning South Arabia and the Horn of Africa.  The Encyclopædia Britannica posits that the biblical narrative about Sheba was based on the ancient civilization of the Sabaeans (Old South Arabian: 𐩪𐩨𐩱 S-b-ʾ) in South Arabia. This view is echoed by Israeli archaeologist Israel Finkelstein and American historian Neil Asher Silberman, both of whom write that "the Sabaean kingdom began to flourish only from the eighth century BCE onward" and that the story of Solomon and Sheba is "an anachronistic seventh-century set piece meant to legitimize the participation of Judah in the lucrative Arabian trade" with regard to the narrative of Solomon leading Israel to conquer Sheba.

The title was given to the chief cup-bearer or the vizier of the Akkadian, Assyrian and Babylonian royal courts in ancient Mesopotamia, and revived by the Assyrians as a military rank during World War I.  Biblical accounts The Hebrew Bible mentions it for one of Sennacherib's messengers to Hezekiah, who was sent to Jerusalem along with the Tartan and the Rabsaris.

02/16/2024 11:47:47 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 1 unknown glyphs in sentence:   Assyrian references  Looking at this from the Assyrian side, Stanley Rosenbaum maintains that the records of Tiglath-Pileser III demonstrate that the Assyrian king distinguished between two kingdoms in the north of Israel. Tiglath-Pileser says he united the northern part (restored as Naphthali in the text) with Assyria, whereas for the southern part, he wrote, "Israel (bit-Humria) overthrew their king Pekah and I placed Hoshea as king over them." Cook thinks that Menahem's tribute to Assyria in 2 Kings 15:19 also suggests the existence of a rival to Menahem's kingdom: When Tiglath-Pileser III appeared in the west, Menahem took the opportunity to enlist his support by sending tribute of a thousand talents of silver, with the idea—as 2 Kings xv 19 puts it—'that he might help him to confirm his hold of the royal power'. This expression may simply indicate Menahem's sense of insecurity in the presence of Assyrian power; but it may equally well indicate the presence of a rival.  Isaiah 7:1,2 speaks of a league between Pekah and King Rezin of Aram that was a threat to Ahaz of Judah. Ahaz and Menahem of Israel (Ephraim) followed a pro-Assyrian policy and were therefore aligned against the coalition of Pekah and the Arameans that sought to withstand Assyria, thus explaining why Menahem felt insecure and sought to buy the support of Assyria. .

02/16/2024 11:47:49 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 6 unknown glyphs in sentence: There is general agreement that the story was created to justify the Jewish appropriation of an originally non-Jewish feast. The festival which the book explains is purim, which is explained as meaning "lot", from the Babylonian word puru.  There are wide-ranging theories regarding the origin of Purim: one popular theory says festival has its origins in a historicized Babylonian myth or ritual in which Mordecai and Esther represent the Babylonian gods Marduk and Ishtar, others trace the ritual to the Persian New Year, and scholars have surveyed other theories in their works Some scholars have defended the story as real history, but the attempt to find a historical kernel to the narrative "is likely to be futile".  Name  The name "Mordecai" is of uncertain origin but is considered identical to the name Marduka or Marduku (), attested as the name of up to four Persian court officials in thirty texts (the Persepolis Administrative Archives) from the period of Xerxes I and his father Darius.  The Talmud (Menachot 64b and 65a) relates that his full name was "Mordechai Bilshan" (which occurs in Ezra 2:2 and Nehemiah 7:7, albeit likely as two separate names in sequence). Hoschander interpreted this as the Babylonian "Marduk-belshunu" (𒀭𒀫𒌓𒂗𒋗𒉡, dAMAR.UTU-EN-šu-nu, meaning "Marduk is their lord") "Mordecai" being thus a hypocorism. .

02/16/2024 11:47:52 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 3 unknown glyphs in sentence: Later, the Greeks kept (approximately) the Phoenician names, albeit they didn't mean anything to them other than the letters themselves; on the other hand, the Latins (and presumably the Etruscans from whom they borrowed a variant of the Western Greek alphabet) and the Orthodox Slavs (at least when naming the Cyrillic letters, which came to them from the Greek by way of the Glagolitic) based their names purely on the letters' sounds.  Numerals The Phoenician numeral system consisted of separate symbols for 1, 10, 20, and 100. The sign for 1 was a simple vertical stroke (𐤖). Other numerals up to 9 were formed by adding the appropriate number of such strokes, arranged in groups of three. The symbol for 10 was a horizontal line or tack (). The sign for 20 (𐤘) could come in different glyph variants, one of them being a combination of two 10-tacks, approximately Z-shaped. Larger multiples of ten were formed by grouping the appropriate number of 20s and 10s. There existed several glyph variants for 100 (𐤙). The 100 symbol could be multiplied by a preceding numeral, e.g. the combination of "4" and "100" yielded 400. The system did not contain a numeral zero.  Derived alphabets .

02/16/2024 11:47:56 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 5 unknown glyphs in sentence: Hel (Old Norse: ) is an afterlife location in Norse mythology and paganism. It is ruled over by a being of the same name, Hel. In late Icelandic sources, varying descriptions of Hel are given and various figures are described as being buried with items that will facilitate their journey to Hel after their death. In the Poetic Edda, Brynhildr's trip to Hel after her death is described and Odin, while alive, also visits Hel upon his horse Sleipnir. In the Prose Edda, Baldr goes to Hel on his death and subsequently Hermóðr uses Sleipnir to attempt to retrieve him.  Etymology The Old Norse feminine proper noun Hel is identical to the name of the entity that presides over the realm, Old Norse Hel. The word has cognates in all branches of the Germanic languages, including Old English  (and thus Modern English hell), Old Frisian helle, Old Saxon hellia, Old High German , and Gothic 𐌷𐌰𐌻𐌾𐌰. All forms ultimately derive from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic feminine noun *haljō ('concealed place, the underworld'). In turn, the Proto-Germanic form derives from the o-grade form of the Proto-Indo-European root *kel-, *kol-: 'to cover, conceal, save'. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.
02/16/2024 11:48:29 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 4 unknown glyphs in sentence: Miletus (; ;  Mīllawānda or 𒈪𒆷𒉿𒋫 Milawata (exonyms); ; ) was an ancient Greek city on the western coast of Anatolia, near the mouth of the Maeander River in ancient Ionia. Its ruins are located near the modern village of Balat in Aydın Province, Turkey. Before the Persian rule that started in the 6th century BC, Miletus was considered among the greatest and wealthiest of Greek cities.  Evidence of first settlement at the site has been made inaccessible by the rise of sea level and deposition of sediments from the Maeander. The first available evidence is of the Neolithic. In the early and middle Bronze Age the settlement came under Minoan influence. Recorded history at Miletus begins with the records of the Hittite Empire, and the Mycenaean records of Pylos and Knossos, in the Late Bronze Age. Miletus was a Mycenaean stronghold on the coast of Asia Minor from  to 1100 BC.  The 13th century BC saw the arrival of Luwian language speakers from south central Anatolia calling themselves the Carians. Later in that century other Greeks arrived. The city at that time rebelled against the Hittite Empire. After the fall of that empire the city was destroyed in the 12th century BC and starting about 1000 BC was resettled extensively by the Ionian Greeks. Legend offers an Ionian foundation event sponsored by a founder named Neleus from the Peloponnesus. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.

02/16/2024 11:50:52 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 10 unknown glyphs in sentence: Theodoric is a Germanic given name. First attested as a Gothic name in the 5th century, it became widespread in the Germanic-speaking world, not least due to its most famous bearer, Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths.  Overview The name was Latinized as Theodoricus or Theodericus, originally from a Common Germanic form *Þeudarīks ("people-ruler") from *þeudō ("people") and *rīks, which would have resulted in a Gothic *𐌸𐌹𐌿𐌳𐌰𐍂𐌴𐌹𐌺𐍃 (*þiudareiks). Anglicized spellings of the name during Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages include Theodoric, Theoderic, Theudoric, Theuderic. Gregory of Tours Latinized the name as Theodorus, in origin the unrelated Greek name Theodore (Θεόδωρος, meaning "God's gift").  As the name survived throughout the Middle Ages, it transformed into a multitude of forms in the languages of Western Europe. These include the High German form Dietrich, abbreviated Dieter, the Low German and Dutch form Diederik, or Dierik, abbreviated Dirck, Dirk, Dik or Diede,  the Norwegian Tjodrik, Diderik and Didrik. Of the Romance languages, French has Thierry and Italian, Portuguese and Spanish has Teodorico. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.
02/16/2024 11:51:48 - WARNING - pixel.data.rendering.pangocairo_renderer - Found 2 unknown glyphs in sentence: In the An = Anum god list, Ninhursag was assigned sixteen additional children beside Paniĝinĝarra, Lillu, Ashgi, and Lisin, named Atugula, Atutur, NIN.LA2, NIG-gumaḫa, Burukaš, Zarzaru, Zurmuzarmu, Nin-BUR.SAL, Šazumaḫ, Ušumšasu, Naĝaršaga, Anmea, Amaea, UR-guru, Urra, and Amaniranna. NIN.LA2 is generally accepted to be the same goddess as Egime, because NIN was glossed as e-gi, while the sign LA2 (𒇲) is believed to have been derived from ME (𒈨).  In Lagash, she was associated with Enlil as his wife, and the mother of Ningirsu (Assimilated with Ninurta.) She is Ninurta's mother as Bēlet-ilī/Mami in Anzu and other myth as well. Some Sumerian sources identify her as both Enlil's wife and sister, likely to rectify earlier traditions where she was Enlil's spouse, before later traditions had the goddess Ninlil as his wife instead. After this change Ninhursag was reassigned as Enlil's elder sister.  Enki was portrayed as Ninhursag's consort in the myth Enki and Ninhursag, in which the eponymous goddess is treated as the same deity as Damgalnuna, Enki's usual wife. However, Dina Katz points out that the goddesses were usually separate. In Enki and Ninmah, Enki instead refers to Ninmah as his sister.  Attendants  In the An = Anum god list, Dingirmah was assigned a sukkal ("divine vizier") named Ekigara. . Consider double-checking that the correct fonts are loaded.
